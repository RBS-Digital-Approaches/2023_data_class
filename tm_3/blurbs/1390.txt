This volume contains some of the most ambitious adaptations of Conan material to date, reprinting the epic battle that leads to Conan becoming the king of Aquilonia in “Conan the Liberator,” the sword-and-sorcery classic “Sword of Skelos,” and the exhilarating “Conan and the Sorcerer.” Collecting selections from The Savage Sword of Conan the Barbarian issues 49 through 60, this volume also includes the frontispieces and pinups from each issue, drawn by such amazing talent as Ernie Chan, Carl Potts, and Neal Adams! As a special bonus, you’ll find a companion piece to Savage Sword Volume 1’s “A Witch Shall Be Born” story-that hasn’t seen print since its original publication in 1980!* For the first time ever, these classic, uncensored tales are being collected in a series of omnibus-style books, with over 500 pages of sword-and-sorcery adventure in each volume &mdash; for the complete Conan collector!* A New York Times bestseller!

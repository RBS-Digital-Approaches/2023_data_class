Twelve-year-old Annabel thought Christmas break was going to be amazing. She’d planned  to stay home in New York City with her best friend and do traditional things like  go ice-skating in Rockefeller Center, hit the after-Christmas sale at Bloomingdale’ s, and scream with the TRL crowd at MTV in Times Square. But when her best friend  bails, Annabel’s mom decides it’s high time Annabel visit her father and his new  family in Australia. Annabel is not pleased about traveling around the world to  meet “the steps”–twelve-year-old fashion-disaster stepsister, five-year-old stepbrother,  and baby half sister–but she’s not going to waste this chance to steal her father  back.From the Compact Disc edition.

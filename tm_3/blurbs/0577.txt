Fresh in his boots and three days in-country, Michael Herr is in a Chinook when a young soldier across from him is gunned. “It took me a month to lose that feeling of being a spectator to something that was part game, part show.”    Written in unforgettable and unflinching detail, Herr captures the chaos and fervor of the war and the surreal insanity of life in that singular combat zone. Selected from Dispatches, one of “the best book to have been written about the Vietnam War” (The New York Times Book Review) and an instant classic straight from the front lines.A Vintage Shorts Vietnam Selection. An ebook short.

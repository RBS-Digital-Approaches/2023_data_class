That’s Why We Don’t Eat Animals uses colorful artwork and lively text to introduce  vegetarianism and veganism to early readers (ages six to ten). Written and illustrated  by Ruby Roth, the book features an endearing animal cast of pigs, turkeys, cows,  quail, turtles, and dolphins. These creatures are shown in both their natural state—rooting  around, bonding, nuzzling, cuddling, grooming one another, and charming each other  with their family instincts and rituals—and in the terrible conditions of the factory  farm. The book also describes the negative effects eating meat has on the environment.  A separate section entitled “What Else Can We Do?” suggests ways children can learn  more about the vegetarian and vegan lifestyles, such as:“Celebrate Thanksgiving with  a vegan feast” or “Buy clothes, shoes, belts, and bags that are not made from leather  or other animal skins or fur.” This compassionate, informative book offers both an  entertaining read and a resource to inspire parents and children to talk about a  timely, increasingly important subject.

A stunning picture-book biography of the High Priestess of Soul and one of the greatest voices of the 20th century.With evocative black-and-white illustrations and moving prose, readers are introduced to Nina Simone, jazz-music legend and civil-rights activist. Shared as a lullaby to her daughter, a soulful song recounts Simone’s career, the trials she faced as an African American woman, and the stand she took during the Civil Rights Movement. This poignant picture book offers a melodic tale that is both a historic account of an iconic figure and an extraordinary look at how far we’ve come and how far we still need to go for social justice and equality. A timeless and timely message aptly appropriate for today’s social and political climates.♦ “A good introduction to Simone’s life, from her early love of music to her rise to the status of legend” —Kirkus Reviews, starred review♦ “Strikingly illustrated” —Booklist, starred review♦ “Hauntingly beautiful illustrations” —Foreword Reviews, starred review“Stirring and powerful. . . ” —BookPage

An uproarious and lacerating meditation on life—and death—by celebrated comedian and actor Denis Leary.   Based on the writer-performer’s hit Off-Broadway show, this rapid-fire monologue sends up society and its ills—disease, drugs, crime, junk culture, the recovery movement, pious political correctness, urban life, and above all, our fear of mortality—with wicked satire and insight.   “High-octane comedy . . . terribly, angrily funny.”—The New York Times   “Absolutely brilliant . . . the real cutting edge of American comedy.”—The Boston Globe

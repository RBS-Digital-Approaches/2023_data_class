There’s justice, and then there’s Custis…When a band of thievin’ cutthroats bushwhacks Longarm’s old friend, peg-leg Richard Collins, the lawman vows to bring them to justice. The local sheriff warns him off though—it may be personal, but it sure ain’t federal, so Deputy U.S. Marshal Custis Long is out of his jurisdiction. Until the sheriff and his four deputies end up just as dead—and Longarm’s left to hunt the killers.   Nothing can stop Longarm—not even wild Ute Indians and the even wilder daughters of a muleskinner. Longarm decides someone has to protect these lovely ladies and closely guard their bodies. This job isn’t exactly in his jurisdiction either—but it’s going to get mighty personal.

Even the dead have to work for a living. In the wake of my resurrection as a member of the bloodsucking undead, I chose to put my investigative reporting talents to good use as a PI in Chicago; I’ve got my work cut out for me.   Mingling with society’s artsy crowd isn’t my favorite pastime, but someone’s got to navigate their way through the world of big money and bigger egos to find the killer of a young talent who deserved more than to be laid out on a canvas.   My snooping has gotten me in occasional trouble with both sides of the law, so I’m used to cops and mobsters using me for target practice. But my thirst for the red stuff is getting out of control. I’m not sure what scares me more: the price on my head, or the darkness gnawing at my gut.   And if that desire isn’t bad enough, there’s the hot-blooded daughter of a client who has big eyes for yours truly—and a jealous boyfriend.

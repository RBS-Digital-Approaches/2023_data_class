On remote Rollrock Island, men go to sea to make their livingsâ€”and to catch their wives.The  witch Misskaella knows the way of drawing a girl from the heart of a  seal, of luring the beauty out of the beast. And for a price a man may  buy himself a lovely sea-wife. He may have and hold and keep her. And he  will tell himself that he is her master. But from his first look into  those wide, questioning, liquid eyes, he will be just as transformed as  she. He will be equally ensnared. And the witch will have her true  payment.Margo Lanagan weaves an extraordinary tale of desire,  despair, and transformation. With devastatingly beautiful prose, she  reveals characters capable of unspeakable cruelty, but also unspoken  love.

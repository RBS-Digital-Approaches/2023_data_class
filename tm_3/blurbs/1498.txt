The classic orchestral fairy tale of a brave boy who captures a wolf comes to brilliant new life. Maria Carlson’s translation and Charles Mikolaycak’s soft, inviting illustrations make for a fine update of Sergei Prokofiev’s beloved story. Paired with the original orchestral composition or read by itself, this book makes a wonderful addition to any family’s story time.Received a Society of Illustrators notation.

With all-new reporting, a completely revised and updated second  edition of the bestseller that takes down the Great Satan of college  sports: the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Every college sport picks its champion by a postseason tournament,  except for one: Divsiion I-A football. Instead of a tournament, fans  are subjected to the Bowl Championship Series, an arcane mix of polling  and mathematical rankings that results in just two teams playing for  the championship. It is, without a doubt, the most hated institution in  all of sports. A recent Sports Illustrated poll found that more  than 90% of sports fans oppose the BCS, yet this system has remained in  place for more than a decade.Building upon top-notch investigative reporting, Wetzel, Peter, and  Passan at last reveal the truth about this monstrous entity and offer a  simple solution for fixing it. Death to the BCS: Totally Revised and  Updated is brought up to date to cover the 2010-2011 season,  listing which teams were screwed by the BCS (such as TCU), how much  money college football left on the table by not having a playoff (based  on 2011 tax filings), and how the calls for the abolition of the BCS  grew even louder this past year. The book also includes findings from  interviews with power players, as well as research into federal tax  records, congressional testimony, and private contracts. The first book  to lay out the unseemly inner workings of the BCS in full detail,  Death to the BCS is a rousing manifesto for bringing fairness  back to one of our most beloved sports.

The only fun, friendly, and surefire defense against the grammar snobs  Having already made a name for herself with Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies, now in its fifth printing, June Casagrande returns with Mortal Syntax, taking on the 101 most frequently attacked usage choices. Dedicating one short chapter to each, Casagrande brings her subject to life, teaching English usage through lively and amusing personal anecdotes. Mortal Syntax includes such chapters as: ? “I wish I was taller” ? “I am continuously watching Simpsons reruns” ? “Was it Horton that heard the Who?” Casagrande’s clear and concise lessons-with entertaining titles and themes-make a potentially prickly subject go down like a spoonful of sugar.

Wherever you visit—Rome, Florence, Venice, Tuscany, Naples, Sicily, etc.—you are in good hands with renowned Italy expert Tim Jepson. He ably guides readers through the storied capital of Rome, Northwest Italy, Lombardy & the Lakes, Venice, Northeast Italy, Emilia-Romagna & the Marche, Florence, Tuscany, Umbria, the South, and Sicily and Sardinia. The opening chapters offer practical advice on planning your trip and explain the country in the context of its rich history and culture, its arts, and, of course, its cuisine. Throughout the guide, contemporary editorial features and experiential sidebars highlight every aspect of Italian life and offer a wide range of activities for the traveler to seek out: learn the history of the Grand Tour; watch the Palio, one of the world’s oldest horseraces; explore the Trulli houses of Puglia; and learn the true history of the Mafia in Sicily. Take a walk through Medieval Rome; hunt for truffles; explore Chianti or Umbria by car; or enjoy a drive along the Valle d’Aosta, around Lago Maggiore, or Lago di Garda. Take a walk from Santissima Annunziata to Santa Trìnita in Florence and learn about the city’s flooding challenges.

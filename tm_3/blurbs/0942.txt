“Zero kisses for me” is a declaration of independence from a youngster who has a family of fond, affectionate relatives. Sometimes kisses are sticky or perfume-y or just plain yucky, and, besides, they’re for babies. They’re not dignified for someone who’s growing up.Our small hero decides that the kissing ban goes for goodnight kisses too. That is, of course, until it’s bedtime and the monsters appear. And everyone knows that the best defense against the monsters is a goodnight kiss from Mom. The ban’s over, and he and his understanding mother come to the conclusion that nobody gets too old for kisses after all. As reassuring as a goodnight kiss, this tender book is sure to become a favorite at bedtime or anytime.

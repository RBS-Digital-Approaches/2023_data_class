This is a must-read for all who’d like to strengthen their connection to the Infinite Mind in order to enjoy a free-flow of abundance, personal blessings, intuitive knowledge and the strong sense of well-being that results from a solid connection.Written more than a century ago, this classic work inspired a generation, selling more than two million copies. It is thought to be the original work of inspirational writing that led to such best-sellers as Think and Grow Rich, and The Power of Positive Thinking. The author, Ralph Waldo Trine, explains that there is only One Life, which he called Infinite Spirit, that underlies, supports and informs all reality. Infinite Spirit takes on the characteristics we ourselves either consciously or subconsciously assume.The result is that we wittingly or unwittingly create ourselves as well as the circumstances and conditions of our lives. If you’ve never read In Tune with the Infinite, you are in for a profound experience and perhaps a revelation. You’ll also find priceless instruction on how to ascend to a life of joy and fulfillment that you may have thought possible only in your dreams.

Deft and dazzling, brash and boyish, Jacob McArthur Mooney makes his debut on the poetry scene with a rare combination of verbal pyrotechnics and honest emotion. Using manic word-charm and an open heart, Mooney invents a prosody for the twenty-first century. With a passionate wisdom about the frustrations of how humans connect, these poems surprise us with protean language and satisfy us with wry, earthy sense.

Storytelling is at its apex although the story itself begins with a   rather mediocre murder. The background scenery takes place from the   Californian West Coast to the deep, forgotten land of Mojave Desert. The   author sets readers’ eye on a LAPD detective, investigating a family   massacre in Los Angeles. Actions, explosions and scorching grounds,   thugs and rogues standing with full intention to kill the opponent, the   bloody vengeance of a swordsman with a dark past….this novel reaches a   height of “a hard-boiled crime action” with great surprising  conclusion  with contemporary touch of “urban mythos”. Once you start  turning  pages, there is no turning back. Quick Draw‘s venom will taint you with an  uncontrollable addiction to read on.

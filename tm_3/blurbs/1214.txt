Is the one you’re with or the one you wish for actually right for you? Check your numbers!  Are you desperately dateless or head over heels in love? Is your love life tragic or the stuff dreams are made of? Is your partner a true romantic or hopelessly practical? Whatever the state of your relationship, the science of numerology can set you on the path to enduring love and happiness.  We apply numbers to explain most things in our lives, so why not use them to find the perfect partner? And you don’t need to be good at math to use the simple tools in this book! Author Max Coppa explains how numerology can easily help you answer vital questions about a prospective love, such as:  *Will he listen to and understand me?  *Does she have baggage from her past?  *Can he communicate effectively how he feels?  *Does she even know what love is?  *Will he be faithful?  Does Your Love Life Add Up? will also help you discover your own relationship strengths and weaknesses; what you should be looking for in a prospective partner; your best months for finding love; and your most compatible partner. An insightful and inspiring relationship book, Does Your Love Life Add Up? takes the guesswork out of love.

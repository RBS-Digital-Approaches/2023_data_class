Get ready to fall for Sandra Chastain’s classic romance set in an irresistible world of Southern sparkle and sizzle.   The last time Lacey Lee Wilcox saw straight-laced corporate type Tyler Winter, he was wearing a permanent scowl with his perfectly tailored suit. So when he shows up at her best friend’s bohemian wedding, Lacey takes it upon herself to keep the cynical exec out of the way. But underneath the pinstripes, Lacey finds an old soul—not to mention an incredible body—and what was supposed to be a vexing day turns into a wild time that leaves Lacey wanting more.   Lacey’s taste for adventure stirs something in Tyler he wasn’t sure he still possessed. It’s something that worries him just a little—after all, he hasn’t become Atlanta’s most successful real-estate mogul by letting loose. But maybe, just maybe, there is such a thing as working too hard . . . and there’s no one Tyler would rather play hooky with than lovely Lacey.  Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from other Loveswept titles.

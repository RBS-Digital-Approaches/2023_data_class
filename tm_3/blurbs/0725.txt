Marjorie Harris returns with a completely updated edition of her sixteen-year-old classic guide to gardening with the environment in mind. In her witty and accessible style, Marjorie Harris – who has been an organic gardener since the 1960s – encourages the Canadian gardener to get back to basics. With information updated for today’s society, Ecological Gardening shows how little use pesticides and chemicals are when making a lush and abundant garden. In 1992, when the book was first published, gardening ecologically was a choice – now, it’s absolutely a matter of proper stewardship. With a society intent on leaving as small a footprint on the earth as possible, there is no better time than now for this important and vital book.

While Puddle is busy enjoying the “music” of Woodcock Pocket, Toot is off to the Congo on an African adventure. “Be sure to listen to the music of the jungle!” Puddle reminds Toot as he takes off, but Toot isn’t so sure he’s good at listening to the music. That’s until he meets a tribe of Bambuti Pygmy Pigs who are good at two things: gathering honey to trade and playing music! They encourage Toot to “get with the beat” and soon he’s singing, dancing, and drumming up a storm all over the jungle.Meanwhile, inspired by a postcard Toot has sent of his new friends, Puddle decides he should find an instrument too. He searches all around the house for something he can play. An over-turned water barrel just might do the trick! Boy, will he have a surprise when Toot gets back! This musical journey both home and abroad ends with laughter and joy and reminds us that music can be found just about anywhere you’re willing to look.

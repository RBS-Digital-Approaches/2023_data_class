This new Traveler guide brings you the best of St. Petersburg, the enchanted, canal-crossed gem built by Peter the Great. Having survived three revolutions and three name changes, the city still lives on gloriously. The guide reviews St. Petersburg’s remarkable history, illuminating the city’s love affair with history, architecture, ballet, and painting. You’ll find directions to and descriptions of all the main sitesthe formidable SS. Peter and Paul Fortress; the famed Hermitage Museum, housed in a series of historic buildings including the baroque Winter Palace; Palace Square; St. Isaac’s Cathedral; Nevsky Prospektalong with such lesser known attractions as the Church of Spilled Blood, Peter the Great’s cabin, and the fascinating Museum of Musical Instruments. Each book offers a wealth of practical informationincluding insider picks of hotels, restaurants, and driving and walking tourscombined with the sophisticated reporting and stunning photographs that are the hallmark of National Geographic.

More and more adults and older children are turning to colouring; a hobby that is nostalgic, creative and therapeutic all at the same time. The Angel & Fairy Colouring Book provide beautiful designs inspired by angels and fairies to colour that are a step beyond childrenâ€™s favourites. The paper is perfect for colouring using marker pens, coloured pencils, crayons or paints, and the designs are printed on just one side of the paper to avoid show-through. There are small, simple motifs that are perfect for colouring in when you have just a few minutes to spare, as well as more absorbing projects for when you have more time. At the front of the book are some ready-coloured images to inspire you, and if you want to colour a favourite image again, they can all be downloaded as PDFs from our website www.searchpress.com. Those who prefer to work onscreen can scan the images from the book and use their favourite software to colour them. Whether you colour for relaxation or wish to incorporate the pictures into larger, more creative projects, there is something for everyone in this beautiful book. Note: The designs used in this book were previously published as Angel & Fairy Designs, in the Design Source Book series (published by Search Press, 2003).

Readers can’t help but get entangled in this USA Today bestselling series that “will draw readers to return  time and again to Sea Harbor.” (New York Times bestselling author Carolyn Hart)  In Sea Harbor the scent of snow fills the salty air, and at Izzy’s  Seaside Studio, the Seaside Knitters feast on cookies, knit their  gifts, and plan their gatherings. And Mary Pisano is transforming the  estate she inherited from her grandfather into a bed-and-breakfast. But  then Mary’s cousin Pamela is found dead on the B and B’s snowy back  porch, and as the holiday draws nigh, the four friends will need all  their crafty know-how to solve the crime.

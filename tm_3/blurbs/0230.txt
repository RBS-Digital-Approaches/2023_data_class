Now a major motion picture starring William Dafoe   A man identified only as “M” is hired by a multinational biotech company to locate and hunt down the last known Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine. Beginning at a remote house on the fringe of a vast wilderness, M embarks on a fateful course deep into the forest and an ancient world of silence and stillness. The Hunter is a haunting adventure tale of obsession and redemption, worthy of Conrad or Melville, where a business proposition takes on mythic aspects, as the quest for an extinct animal becomes a search not for ultimate profit but for the essence of life that technology has all but crushed. “Impressive.”—The New York Times Book Review   “Strong and Hypnotic.”— Don DeLillo “[Leigh’s] narration is as clear-eyed and cold-blooded as her hero.”—The New Yorker “A memorable debut, one full of many rewards and a subtle, precise beauty.”—San Francisco Chronicle

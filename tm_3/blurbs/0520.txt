#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER   Becky Brandon’s life is blooming. She’s working at London’s newest big store, The Look, house-hunting with husband Luke (her secret wish is a Shoe Room) . . . and she’s pregnant. She couldn’t be more overjoyed—especially after discovering that shopping cures morning sickness. Everything has to be perfect for her baby: from the designer nursery and the latest stroller to top-of-the-line medical care.   But when the must-have celebrity obstetrician Becky’s been so desperate to see turns out to be Luke’s glamorous, intellectual ex-girlfriend, Becky’s perfect world starts to crumble. She’s shopping for two . . . but are there three in her marriage?   Praise for Sophie Kinsella and Shopaholic & Baby   “From sonograms to the hottest baby strollers to tricked-out birthing rooms . . . Kinsella’s ode to baby blues is both sly and slapstick.”—Publishers Weekly   “Faster than a swiping Visa, more powerful than a two-for-one coupon, able to buy complete wardrobes in a single sprint through the mall—it’s Shopaholic!”—The Washington Post   “Kinsella’s heroine is blessed with the resilience of ten women, and her damage-limitation brain waves are always good for a giggle.”—Glamour (U.K.)   “As fun as a shopping spree.”—Entertainment WeeklyFrom the Hardcover edition.

The national bestselling author of the beloved Mithgar fantasies, Dennis L. McKiernan continues his enchanting seasonal fairytale cycle with a spellbinding story of love and legend.   Once upon an autumn eve, a wounded knight named Sieur Luc rides into the Autumnwood—and into the heart of Liaze, Princess of that demesne.   Liaze soon discovers that Sieur Luc is not an ordinary knight, but a man with a secret past—a past not even he knows, filled with enemies he does not suspect and allies he has not seen. And even as love blooms between Luc and Liaze, dark forces snatch him away.   The Fates themselves intervene—but the Fates are bound by rules of their own, and can only give guidance in riddles and spoken enigmas. Even so, alone and grimly determined, Liaze sets out on a desperate quest to follow the trail of her true love. But no tracks whatsoever mark the way, and for guidance, she has only arcane words and the way of her heart.“Dennis L. McKiernan always manages to enchant his readers with his fabulous fantasy novels . . . Readers will not be disappointed with this beautiful adult fairy tale.”—Midwest Book Review

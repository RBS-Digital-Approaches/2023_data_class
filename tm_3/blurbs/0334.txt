Toshinari Seki takes goofing off to new heights. Every day, on or around  his school desk, he masterfully creates his own little worlds of wonder,  often hidden to most of his classmates. Unfortunately for Rumi  Yokoi, his neighbor at the back of their homeroom, his many games, dioramas, and  projects are often way too interesting to ignore; even when they are  hurting her grades.

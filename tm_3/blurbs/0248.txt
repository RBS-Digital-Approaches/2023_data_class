When five savages deserve cold-blooded justice, all it takes is one man to deliver it…Custis Long’s about to get hitched to an upstanding lady who’s got a fine young son. With this ready-made family he’s looking to settle down as a Colorado cattle rancher. Too good to last? You bet. She just ate lead during a robbery gone bad. Now he’s really looking to tie the knot—around the chicken necks of the cutthroats who blew away his beautiful bride-to-be.   This time Longarm is a one-man execution squad. Crazy with vengeance he’s  following two rules of the hunt: track them and kill them.From the Paperback edition.

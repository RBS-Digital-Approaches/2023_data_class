Fifteen-year-old Celia Bonnet, nicknamed “Rat,” lives a peaceful life with her mother, Vanessa, a free-spirited local beauty, and Morgan, the nine-year-old orphan they have taken in. Their farmhouse compound, nestled just north of the Spanish Catalan border, is surrounded by artichoke fields and glittering ocean, cliffs where they can spy down on the rich tourists below. But when Vanessa falls for a dangerous new boyfriend, Rat must leave this place she loves.  Together with Morgan, Rat sets out for London to find the father she has never met and the man who might finally explain to Rat where she belongs. An enthralling novel with a luminous sense of place, Rat is the story of a bold, rousing heroine for our times.

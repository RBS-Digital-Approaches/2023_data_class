These include instructions for character formation and space  to practice writing, as well as a selection of vocabulary for further  reading and writing. The vocabulary are all commonly used words that  students can put to immediate use in conversation; and their readings —    pronounced by a professional voice actor —   are available as free  downloads from the Net. Frequent review pages allow students to test  their understanding of the hiragana at various stages.The  appendixes offer additional practice exercises, as well as grids for  playing hiragana Battleship and Bingo. There are also 120 pull-out  flashcards for playing Memory, Scrabble, and other games.

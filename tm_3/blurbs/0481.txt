Strange, wonderful sights await Girl and Dragon as the inseparable friends journey far across the sea in a third warmhearted and beautifully illustrated tale.Dragon and Girl are the very best of friends, and they share the very same dream: to sail to the farthest far-away. So they set out to sea, Girl sailing on Dragon’s back. For a year and a day the two friends search up, down, and around for the faraway place, meeting creatures along the way: dolphins, whales, and even some snarly, sword-wielding pirates. And when Girl and Dragon finally reach the farthest far-away, they still share a heart and the very same dream — home. Randy Cecil’s muted, dreamy artwork and Barbara Joosse’s softly poetic words cast a comforting spell over imaginative explorers, leaving them safe with the knowledge that however far you go, there is nothing quite like coming home again with someone you love.

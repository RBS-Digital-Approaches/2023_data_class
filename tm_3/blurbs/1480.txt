Barry Broadfoot’s oral histories brought Canada’s past to vivid life. In Next-Year Country, he travelled across the prairie provinces, speaking to ordinary farmers, labourers, immigrants, and others who recall the challenges and achievements they faced as they settled and helped to build western Canada during the first half of the twentieth century. What emerges is a collection of anecdotes that celebrate the courage, independence, and indomitable spirit of westerners.

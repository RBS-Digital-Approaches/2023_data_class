HAS FOUND A STERLING NEW CHAMPION IN PHILLIPS.”–The New York Times Book Review“A FUTURE HARD-BOILED CLASSIC–TIGHT, COLD, AND CACKLING WITH IRONY.

[that] may remind readers of Fargo or Pulp Fiction.” –Detroit Free Press“I SIMPLY CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT SCOTT PHILLIPS WILL DO NEXT. [This] funny, tough first novel felt like it was written by an old pro, an Elmore Leonard we’ve never heard about who’s discovered a place where the criminals are really dumb, the low-lifes are oh-so-fun to watch and, if somebody just happens to get what he deserves, there’s no one to blame.”–RICHARD RUSSO   Author of Straight Man“A DARKLY COMIC, SOMETIMES BRUTAL PIECE OF NOIR FICTION.”–The Denver PostFinalist for the Hammett Prize

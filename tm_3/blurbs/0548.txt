Dark Horse’s critically acclaimed Conan, now available in an affordable, value-priced omnibus! Showcasing the work of fan favorites Timothy Truman and Tomás Giorello, this action-packed omnibus includes stories such as “The Hand of Nergal,” an unfinished fragment by creator Robert E. Howard; the powerful “Black Colossus,” in which Conan tries his hand at being a professional warrior; and a series of tales which detail the Cimmerian’s return to his homeland and his familial roots. Also featuring guest artist and horror master Richard Corben, this is an essential addition to any Conan fan’s library!

Talk is our key action tool for moving forward at work and in our personal life, yet how often do we feel we’ve missed crucial opportunities or failed in our communication? This book explains why effective talk can be truly transformative and provides a practical guide to having the kinds of conversations that will turn your life around. Expert psychologist and coach Sarah Rozenthuler provides the seven keys to success: calling up your courage, focusing on your intention, creating positive space, speaking your truth, having a flexible style, cultivating constructive controversy, and obtaining closure. Throughout the book you will find real – life examples of problem situations, including negotiating with difficult neighbours, asking for a raise and ending a long – term relationship. The author shows through extended sample dialogue how, in each case, a difficult situation was worked through and a positive result achieved.

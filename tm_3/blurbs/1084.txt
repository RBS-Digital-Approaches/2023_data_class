A determined child goes the extra mile to try to cheer the lonely half moon  Have you ever looked up at the half-moon hiding in the night sky and thought it looked just the littlest bit lonely without its other half?   Imagine . . . having no one to glow with no one to play with no one to share how much you like puppies and big, fuzzy bears.   If you’re like this determined young child, you might stay up every night to keep the moon company. Maybe if you share your treats and toys and stories, you’ll cheer him up.   But the moon is very shy, so it might take some time. Still, if you’re very very patient, you just might make a new friend.

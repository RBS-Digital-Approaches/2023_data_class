Readers of The Enormous Egg will dive right into this adventurous story about what happens when an average eleven-year-old boy becomes the parent of a giant T-rex!In the unremarkable town of Menominee Springs, Wisconsin, lives a twelve-year-old explorer named Martin, who one day stumbles across something remarkable. It’s an egg. But not just any egg—a dinosaur egg. And a week later, Martin becomes the proud parent of . . . a Tyrannosaurus rex! As the summer unfolds, Martin finds it harder and harder to keep Rufus hidden from rest of the world. And then it gets ugly. Can Martin save Rufus from his parents, his neighbors, and most importantly, the owner of the town carnival? With the help of his best friend, Audrey, and his science teacher, Mr. Ekhart, Martin must uncover his inner hero and find Rufus a home, even if it means losing the one thing he’s come to really care about.Praise for Raising Rufus: “The premise of Fulk’s first children’s book has immediate appeal, and Martin’s difficulties with his father (who wishes his son was more into sports than science) and school bullies are handled well.”–Publishers Weekly “Fulk’s debut novel is a poignant story of a boy’s coming into his own. . . . Readers will cheer for Martin and Rufus in this funny twist on a boy-and-his-dog story.”–Kirkus Reviews From the Hardcover edition.

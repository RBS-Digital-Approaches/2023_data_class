Socrates, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Mesmer, William James, Pavlov, Freud, Piaget,  Erikson, and Skinner. Each of these thinkers recognized that human beings could examine,  comprehend, and eventually guide or influence their own thought processes, emotions,  and resulting behavior.  The lives and accomplishments of these pillars of psychology,  expertly assembled by Morton Hunt, are set against the times in which the subjects  lived.  Hunt skillfully presents dramatic and lucid accounts of the techniques and  validity of centuries of psychological research, and of the methods and effectiveness  of major forms of psychotherapy. Fully revised, and incorporating the dramatic  developments of the last fifteen years, The Story of Psychology is a graceful and  absorbing chronicle of one of the great human inquiries—the search for the true causes  of our behavior.

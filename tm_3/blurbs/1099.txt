The latest book by the award-winning photographer Bernhard Edmaier presents his stunning vistas of water in awe-inspiring views of our planet. In his seminal photography books, Bernhard Edmaier capturesdreamy, color-saturated, seemingly abstract images of earthfrom above. In this new volume, Edmaier looks at water—fromboth the air and the ground—as a source of life and one of themost important landscape-shaping forces on earth. Readerswill be enthralled by Edmaier’s stunning shots of water in allits forms—rivers and streams, deltas and floodplains, surgingon the coasts, frozen in glaciers, as vaporous clouds, and thespray over erupting volcanoes. Edmaier covers familiar and farflunglocations on every continent: from Alaska to the AmericanSouthwest; Costa Rica to Chile and Argentina; Canada,Greenland, and Russia; from Germany and Switzerland, to Italy,Croatia, Iceland, and Norway; from Djibouti to Kenya, Tanzania,Namibia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo; along withAustralia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. His pictures not onlydocument the beauty of these places but they also tell a storyof the changes our earth and its water systems are undergoingas the result of climate change—from desertification to Arcticthaw and rising sea levels. Presented in an extra-large formatthat magnifies both the intensity and the details of Edmaier’swork, this extraordinary and important book documents water’spower to create and destroy; to give life and take it away.

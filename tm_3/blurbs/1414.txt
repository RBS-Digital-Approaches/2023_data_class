God’s Spirit once took the prophet Ezekiel to a vast valley filled with brittle, parched-dry bones—a potent picture of widespread spiritual dryness. But by the Word of God proclaimed through Ezekiel’s mouth, those piles of bones took on sinew and flesh and skin, then were infused with life-giving, wind-driven breath from the Spirit of God. A sweeping vista of skeletons was turned instead into a force of fired-up warriors ready to do battle for the Lord. A transformation just as dramatic is what God wants to generate in our individual lives today and in the life of His church. Dry Bones Dancing is about escaping religious dryness to move on to true spiritual passion. The results will be an experience of supernatural power and peace in the presence of God as you are invited to go deeper and see God’s character and glory as never before.Broken . . . Whole Parched . . . Flourishing Dry Bones . . . Dancing Is the landscape of your spirit all too desert-like? Then it’s time for a change. It’s time for a miracle. And God is ready to give it to you. Author and speaker Dr. Tony Evans boldly declares the truth: God’s people are not meant to dwell in a lifeless valley. But if we are to embrace pure joy and rich passion once again, God requires a humble heart. Evans shows desert-dwellers how to pinpoint what brought them there in the first place—and how to get out. Experience spiritual nourishment and vitality once again. And get ready… …to dance! Story Behind the BookAfter many years of ministering to Christians burned out by religion and spiritually dry, Tony Evans searched the Scriptures for answers to share with everyone who is seeking to rekindle their passion for God. He found the perfect passage in Ezekiel. Through his study of the story, he bolstered his own spiritual passion, and now he shares it with those seeking to be rebuilt and reenergized by and for God.From the Hardcover edition.

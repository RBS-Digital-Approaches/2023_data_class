Conanâ€™s plan to plunder a gold mine in the mountains of Turan goes awry when he discovers that the mine has just been robbed! Taking treasure from thieves has to be easier than from a fortress, so the angry barbarian pursues the burglars across the frozen peaks to reclaim his prize. But danger lurks amongst the icy crags, where nature itself is the deadliest of foes!The Chronicles of Conan collects classic Conan the Barbarian tales never-before collected and unavailable for over a quarter of a century.

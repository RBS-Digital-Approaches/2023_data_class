Fisherman Bible Studyguides have been a trusted name in Bible study for almost thirty years. With outstanding authors, an emphasis on personal growth, and over eighty titles, the Fisherman guides offer a breadth and depth of biblical study not found in any other series. Fisherman are written with a commitment to the unique authority of the Bible in our lives. Nondenominational, nonsectarian, and suitable for new Christians and mature Christians, Fisherman have a broad appeal with a biblical base. King David: Trusting God for a Lifetime, a twelve-week Bible character study, takes an in-depth look at the person referred to in Scripture as “a man after God’s own heart,” giving insight into how to cope with conflict and depression, how to maintain personal integrity, and how to trust God for a lifetime.

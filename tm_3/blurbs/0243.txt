“A rich and intriguing story whcih the authors disentangle with great skill.”–Sunday TelegraphFrom Antony Beevor, the internationally bestselling author of D-Day and The Battle of ArnhemIn this brilliant synthesis of social, political, and cultural history, Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper present a vivid and compelling portrayal of the City of Lights after its liberation. Paris became the diplomatic battleground in the opening stages of the Cold War.

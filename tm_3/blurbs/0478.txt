Summer is all about friendship and fun. Toss this journal into your bag with a magazine and a water bottle, grab your friends, and head out into the sun, the beach, the playing field, the woods—wherever the spirit of adventure takes you. With all the fun components of a yearbook (aka superlatives) and none of the boring ones (aka school), this is an activity book that will help you truly “Have A Great Summer J” that you and your pals will always remember…or, at the very least, this journal will have taught you how to: ·         Bake a Banana ·         Tell a ghost story ·         Make a friendship bracelet ·         Turn a profit at a soccer game ·         Navigate by the stars ·         And So. Much. More.

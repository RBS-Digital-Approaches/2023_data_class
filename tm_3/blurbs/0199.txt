Here are stories of his family, then and now, tales of his close relationship to nature and her creatures, accounts of how his life and legacy have changed since publishing his memoir, and a tribute to his fallen friends. The Life and Times of the Code Talker is the perfect purchase for those who never want Chester Nez’s stories to end…  Includes a preview of Code Talker: The First and Only Memoir by One of the Original Navajo Code Talkers of WWIIINCLUDES NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PHOTOS

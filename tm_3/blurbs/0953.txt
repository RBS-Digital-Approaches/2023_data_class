The friends in the band Sweet Marguerite always back each other up—onstage and off.  But just as the band is about to make it big, an impulsive game threatens to tear them apart.   Tracie can’t think straight. The sexiest guy she knows is flirting with her—and he’s hot enough to make her forget everything that matters—including her boyfriend.    Mark can’t believe his luck. He has a great band and a beautiful girlfriend. So why can’t he keep his mind off the exotic new lead singer, Lily?    Sienna is psyched. She has worked hard for the band’s success and she loves her boyfriend Mark. Life would be perfect—if Lily would just go away.    Tracie, Mark, and Sienna are partying at the beach with the rest of the band, celebrating their big break and dreaming of stardom . . . until the moment one simple question changes everything: Just for fun, why don’t we trade boyfriends and girlfriends?

For the first time, the best work of a distinctive master of American noir is available in authoritative e-book editions from The Library of America. In The Burglar (1953), first published like all his later novels as a paperback original, David Goodis explores his characteristic notion of the criminal gang as surrogate family, wracked by thwarted aspirations and contradictory desires. Other David Goodis novels available as Library of America E-Book Classics include: Nightfall, Dark Passage, The Moon in the Gutter, and Street of No Return.

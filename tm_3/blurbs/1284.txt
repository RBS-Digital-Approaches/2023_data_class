A contemporary novel of sisterhood, the South, and matters of the heart.   Teensie MacAllester’s two elder sisters consider her an insignificant appendage to their illustrious family. For fifteen years they have been delighted to let her care for their ailing relatives. After all, Teensie is both a nurse and a Friday’s child, naturally loving and giving.  As Teensie deferred her life, a dream sustained her: autocratic King MacAllester promised her the bulk of his estate. But when King’s will is read it divides his property equally among his daughters. Teensie’s share is scarcely enough to make a new start. Her sisters have a solution: Teensie can continue to serve as the family care-giver. But Teensie is determined to claim a life of her own. Throwing off the yoke of family expectations, Teensie sets in motion some surprising changes.

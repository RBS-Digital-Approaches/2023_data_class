Jenn and Greg are enjoying the last week of their annual summer holiday in Majorca, off the coast of southern Spain. Their days are languorous, the time passing by in a haze of Rioja-soaked lunches, hours at the beach, and lazy afternoon sex in their beautiful villa. It is the perfect summer idyll . . . until Greg’s teenage daughter—Jenn’s stepdaughter—Emma, arrives with her new boyfriend, Nathan, in tow. The next seven days are a brilliantly paced fever dream of attraction between Jenn and the reckless yet mesmerizing Nathan. The Lemon Grove is an intense pas de deux of push and pull, risk and consequence . . . and moral rectitude, as it gets harder and harder for Jenn to stifle her compulsion.

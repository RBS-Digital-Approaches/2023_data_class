Christmas is coming, and our young hero wants to buy his best friend, Dragon, the perfect present. He and Dragon take job after hilarious job, earning enough to buy a deluxe Knight Boy action set—but they eventually realize that the best part of Christmas is sharing what you have with those in need. In the third book of David Biedrzycki’s series about a boy and his pet dragon, we learn the true meaning of Christmas—and have a great time doing it. This book has it all: holiday cheer, humor, a meaningful message and a ton of heart.

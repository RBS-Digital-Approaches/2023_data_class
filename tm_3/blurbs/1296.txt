Serafleana loves to jump, and when her family joins the traveling acrobatic troupe the Fleatastics, she dreams of having her own act. But her family wants her to be part of their parasite pyramid, and nobody gives small Serafleana the chance to show how high she can soar. But on the first day that Serafleana’s family performs, someone in the audience says the forbidden “T” word—treat, which no dog can sleep through! When their host dog goes wild,  Serafleana finally gets the chance to prove what she can do, saving her flea community and earning her own spot in the show at the same time. The art for this tale of a determined flea includes a multitude of subplots and dialog to follow, making this the sort of book that children will want to read over and over again.

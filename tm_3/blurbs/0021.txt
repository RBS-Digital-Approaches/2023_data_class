From Jonathan Raban, the award–winning author of Bad Land and Passage to Juneau, comes this quirky and insightful story of what can happen when one can and does go home again.For the past thirty years, George Grey has been a ship bunker in the fictional west African nation of Montedor, but now he’s returning home to England-to a daughter who’s a famous author he barely knows, to a peculiar new friend who back in the sixties was one of England’s more famous singers, and to the long and empty days of retirement during which he’s easy prey to the melancholy of memories, all the more acute since the woman he loves is still back in Africa. Witty, charming and masterly crafted, Foreign Land is an exquisitely moving tale of awkward relationships and quiet redemption.

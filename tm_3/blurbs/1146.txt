How 12 Tibetan Buddhist Teachers Succeed in Merging East and West – including Pema Chödrön, Joan Halifax, and Thubten Chodron, among othersPersonal  reflections and life stories from 12 contemporary female Tibetan  Buddhist teachers, both Westerners and Tibetans, who share insights into  how they discovered their true calling, overcame barriers, and  developed the courage, determination, and wisdom to progress on the  spiritual path.What drives a young London librarian to board a ship to India, meditate in a remote cave by herself for twelve years, and then build a flourishing nunnery in the Himalayas? How does a surfer girl from Malibu become the head of the main international organization for Buddhist women? Why does the daughter of a music executive in Santa Monica dream so vividly of peacocks one night that she chases these images to Nepal, where she finds the love of her life in an unconventional young Tibetan master?

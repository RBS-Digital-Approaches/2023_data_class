Adrienne Staff and Sally Goldenbaum delight in this sparkling duet between a princely society man and his everyday princess.   At first the situation is impossible for Ellen Farrell to believe. A stunning, successful sex-god of a man chasing after a no-nonsense, hardworking registered nurse? But that’s exactly what happens when Ellen crosses paths with star conductor Armand Dante. Their elegant dinner leads to flowers, passion, and everything she once imagined in her wildest dreams. But Ellen’s been burned before, and she refuses to let herself be seduced so easily. After all, falling in love with a man like Armand is simple. But having him fall back? Never going to happen.   Except Armand is falling. Hard. Ellen is the only woman he’s ever met who sees past the trappings of his success—and the pressures of his societal responsibilities—to the real man underneath. And though she is new to his glittering world of concertos and champagne, she has a verve he’s not sure he can live without. But when Ellen finds out about the true cost of his success, Armand must persuade her that loving him is worth risking her heart.  Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: Tempting a Devil, The Story Guy, and Friday Night Alibi.

The fourth volume of Louis L’Amour’s collected short stories features more than forty  of the master’s greatest adventure tales in a keepsake edition to cherish for generations.  This unique collection gathers stories guaranteed to thrill and delight readers again  and again, establishing why Louis L’Amour is truly America’s favorite storyteller. Louis L’Amour’s tales of adventure cannot be surpassed for sheer storytelling excitement,  and they stand as a testament to his legendary appeal. Here are timeless stories  of danger and daring, wanderlust and heroism, filled with ordinary men and women  facing often insurmountable challenges with courage, dignity, honor–and heart. Perhaps  never before has a single volume contained so many breathtaking thrills: from the  down-on-his-luck fortune hunter who risks everything to save a diamond-hunting couple  walking straight into a jungle massacre to  the mystery “hero” aboard a downed commercial  plane dangling six hundred feet above certain doom. You’ll trek across the harsh  steppes of East Asia with an American widow and her young son among a fierce nomadic  warrior people, and you’ll relive a harrowing tale of survival at sea against thirst,  madness, and the elements as a common seaman redefines extraordinary courage as simply  “doing his job.” Whether joining an American captain running a cargo ship through  Japanese-controlled waters during World War II, only to find his vessel hijacked  by traitorous pirates, or marveling at the resourcefulness of a young woman pushed  to the limits of endurance as she flees a killer through a primeval forest, these  adrenaline-laced tales of mystery, suspense, murder, and survival never let up and  will keep your heart pounding long after the final page. From those numbering a  few intense pages to novella-length works, the tales in this action-packed anthology  bear all the trademarks of the master’s touch–the historical accuracy, memorable  characters, and timeless themes that have earned Louis L’Amour his unique place among  American writers.

It’s a fact: Women are built differently than men. That means that women’s bodies react differently to training, nutrition, and sometimes even riding itself. Yet most bicycling books are written without addressing any of these differences. This comprehensive cycling book addresses how to gear up and prepare for any goal-whether you want to ride for pleasure, complete your first 100 miles, or line up at a race. Top professional cyclist Selene Yeager has teamed up with the editors of Bicycling magazine to create The Bicycling Big Book of Cycling for Women, an easy-to-follow instructional manual geared specifically toward women and their unique needs. It breaks down the sport of cycling into easily digestible sections, beginning with the history of women’s cycling and progressing into equipment, lifestyle, technique, training, fitness goals, nutrition, maintenance, and more. The book also includes a women-specific section regarding hormones and exercise performance, cycling while menstruating, cycling while pregnant, how menopause affects your training, and how specific parts of the female body are uniquely affected by cycling. The Bicycling Big Book of Cycling for Women is an indispensible, lifelong guide for every female cyclist.

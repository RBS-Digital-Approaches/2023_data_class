From the New York Times bestselling author of Superstition and Bait comes the story of Kate White, a single mom and successful prosecutor in the Philadelphia DA’s office. She’s used to challenges, but none as terrifying as Mario Castellanos, the violent career criminal she’s been hired to convict. But Kate and Mario have already met—during one of the darkest periods of Kate’s past. And Mario knows her secret.   Now Kate has only one option: Play Mario’s game. But when murder becomes part of it, homicide detective Tom Braga is called in to investigate. And as another threat, even more menacing, emerges from the shadows of Kate’s past, she realizes the only person she can turn to for help is Tom—the one man she can never trust with the truth.

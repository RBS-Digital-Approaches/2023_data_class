Seinfeld.  For more than 33 million viewers, the Emmy Award-winning television show has become a Thursday night ritual.  Now, even though the show has ended, Jerry Seinfeld’s distinct brand of humor can still be yours.  Ted L.  Nancy’s first book, Letters from a Nut, with an introduction by Jerry Seinfeld, now has more than 225,000 copies in print.  In More Letters From a Nut, master-prankster Nancy shares even more sidesplittingly funny letters he has written and the unbelievable true responses he has received.

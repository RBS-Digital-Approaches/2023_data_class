“Two-headed monsters, giant tentacles, angry demons – Lovecraft Middle School is great creepy fun!” –Ransom Riggs, author of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children   This second novel in the Tales from Lovecraft Middle School series begins right where Professor Gargoyle ended.  Seventh-grader Robert Arthur has discovered that two of his classmates are actually sinister snake-women in disguise. Even worse, his new middle school is full of “gates” to a terrifying alternate dimension – a haunted mansion full of strange spirits and monstrous beasts.  For Robert to protect his teachers and classmates, he’ll need to return to this haunted dimension with his best friends Glenn and Karina.   Can they uncover the secrets of Lovecraft Middle School before it’s too late?   The Slither Sisters features more bizarre beasts, more strange mysteries, and more adventure.  It’s perfect for readers ages 10 and up. Best of all, the cover features a state-of-the-art “morphing” photo portrait – so you can personally witness the sisters transforming into their slithering alter egos.  You won’t believe your eyes!

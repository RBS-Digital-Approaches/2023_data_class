Galen and his apprentice, Raffi, are searching for the ancient relics with the power to save their city, Anara. First they hear of Flian’s Coronet, which might be the only way to defeat the encroaching evil—but the Coronet has not been seen for centuries, and they must enlist some dangerous allies to find it. And then, when Raffi knows he is being hunted, he must face his deepest fears in the deepest, darkest part of Anara, the Pits of Maar—and there, evil is unmasked, loyalty is tested, and the greatest secret in all of the city is revealed.“Anyone who has kept up with the story will be on tenterhooks.”—Kirkus Reviews on The Hidden Coronet

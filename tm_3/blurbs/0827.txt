Ahoy, mateys! Get on board! Boats and the need for them have been around for thousands of years.  Reed boats might have been the first boat ever to be built. The Vikings  built wooden ships that were strong and ornate. And now boats like an  Aircraft Carrier house 6,000 people and can carry over 100 planes. In  Jerry Pallottaâ€™s newest book we get to see an entire alphabet of  floating wonders. David Biedrzycki has provided dramatic settings for a variety of  boats and captures the mood of each body of water. In one he paints a  calm lake where a red canoe glides across the water and in another the  stormy swells of an angry ocean tossing a three-masted Xebec. The facts  about each boat are sprinkled with traditional Pallotta humor.

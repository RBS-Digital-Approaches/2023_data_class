In Yoga for Healthy Feet, Donald Moyer shares his insights into working with the feet and ankles gained through forty years of teaching yoga. It includes anatomy and architecture of the feet, as understood from a yogic perspective, principles for aligning and balancing the feet, as well as suggestions for addressing common problems, such as foot cramps, sprained ankles, hammer toes, bunions, and plantar fasciitis. The book also includes descriptions of twenty-five poses that most concern the feet, with an emphasis on standing poses and sitting poses, the use of props such as blocks, straps, and wedges to support the feet and alleviate discomfort, and practice sequences for developing awareness, straightening toes, strengthening arches, improving balance, and supporting ankles.

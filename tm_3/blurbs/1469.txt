Forgotten Realms creator Ed Greenwood opens the adventures of an unlikely new band of heroes who get into a bit more trouble than usual in the fabled port city of Waterdeep, but soon discover some of the seedier corners of the wider Realms — the hard way! Joined by artist Lee Ferguson and Sal Buscema, this new series kicks off a deadly tale with a kidnapping that is more — and less — than it seems.

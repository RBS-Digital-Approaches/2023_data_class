Get ready for mischievous monkeys! Moving islands! And a splashy adventure with illustrations on almost every page.   When Oliver’s explorer parents go missing, he sets sail to find them with some new friends. There’s a grumpy albatross, a nearsighted mermaid . . . even a living island! But the high seas are more exciting and strange than Oliver could have imagined. Can he and his crew spar with sarcastic seaweed, outrun an army of sea monkeys, win a fabulous maritime fashion contest, and defeat a wicked sea captain in time to save Mom and Dad?   For early chapter book readers who are ready for something longer, the Not-So-Impossible Tales are packed with silly humor, action, and larger-than-life fun. This book was previously published in hardcover as Oliver and the Seawigs.   “[A] sly and dashing tale. . . Readers’ ribs aren’t the only ones that get a vigorous tickle.” —Kirkus Reviews   “A delightfully told, beautiful tale of nautical hairdressing, saltwater primates and sarcastic seaweed—this is my kind of book!” —Chris Riddell, award-winning co-creator of the Edge Chronicles

The first time I meet an angel, it is Raphael and I am eighteen.Miriam is an unassuming college freshman stuck on campus after her spring break plans fall through. She’s not a religious girl–when pressed she admits reluctantly to believing in a higher power. Truth be told, she’s about as comfortable speaking about her faith as she is about her love life, which is to say, not at all. And then the archangel Raphael pays Miriam a visit, and she finds herself on a desperate mission to save two of her contemporaries. To top it all off, her twin brother, Mo, has also had a visitation, but from the opposite end of the good-evil spectrum, which leaves Miriam to wonder–has she been blessed and her brother cursed or vice versa? And what is the real purpose behind her mission?From the Hardcover edition.

Oh no! Mean and nasty rats are taking over a vacant lot that a group of bugs call home. The rats love two things: bullying the bugs and enjoying all the trash and litter that’s piling up. Luckily, help is coming soon. Volunteers will arrive on Recycling Day and not only drive away the awful rats, but explain all about how recycling works and why it’s a good idea.

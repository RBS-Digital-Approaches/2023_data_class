Airlines of the Jet Age provides the first comprehensive history of the world’s airlines from the early 1960s to the present day. It begins with an informative introductory chapter on the infancy of flight and the development of air-transport craft used during the First and Second World Wars, and then wings into the “first” Jet Age–the advent of jet airlines. It continues through the “second” Jet Age of wide-bodied aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and DC-10, and closes with the introduction of the “third” Jet Age, which begins with the giant double-decked Airbus A380. This reference book is an unparalelled reference for aviation buffs, covering airlines around the globe and throughout the modern eras of human flight. The last book written by renowned airline historian R.E.G. Davies, Airlines of the Jet Age is the ultimate resource for information and insight on modern air transport.

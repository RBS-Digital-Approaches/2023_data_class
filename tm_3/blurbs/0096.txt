Here is the story of Bill Monroe, whose deep Kentucky roots helped him to create the unique American music called bluegrass, as told by award-winning author Barb Rosenstock and acclaimed illustrator Edwin Fotheringham.Bill Monroe loved many things: playing music, his big family, and his home in the bluegrass state of Kentucky. Even though his eyes were crossed and didn’t work right, Bill’s ears worked hard, picking out all sorts of sounds around his treasured home: rushing streams, wailing winds, and sundown jamborees with his family. Through heartache and hard times, Bill held on to these sounds that reminded him of home. Award-winning author Barb Rosenstock and illustrator Edwin Fotheringham beautifully capture the ups and downs of Bill Monroe’s musical journey, and how his deep Kentucky roots helped him create a unique form of American music–bluegrass. Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash and Jerry Garcia all credit Bill Monroe with influencing their music.

In this western in Ralph Compton’s USA Today bestselling series, a man’s shot at the bigtime might be the shot that kills him…   Outlaw Wes Cavanaugh knows that crime doesn’t always pay—at least not much. That’s why he and his partner, Mose, are willing to pay Jimmy Stock for information on a job that’s guaranteed to pay off big.   Jimmy’s made a career of selling tips to bandits, but the job he sells Wes—a payroll train about to leave Omaha—requires more than information. It requires a straight shooter who can hit targets from a long distance away…and in the outlaw business, even a straight shooter can’t be trusted.More Than Six Million Ralph Compton Books In Print!

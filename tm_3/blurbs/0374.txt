A general “how-to” book for international birding is absent. This unprecedented new book by top-selling author Les Beletsky (Birds of the World, Birdsongs) will aim to explain why birders are interested in going to other countries and where they like to go. It will act as a “bridge” for domestic birders, allowing them to build on their exciting new knowledge as beginner birders by accessing other countries to see species they cannot see at home. The book, in six chapters, will describe each continent with respect to birds and birding, and tell what kinds of birds birders seek out in those places, along with practical pointers on international birding contacts and field guides. Engaging sidebars throughout the book, tell short stories of birding adventures looking for special birds or unique birding locations.

You have a prime-time date with a brutal murderer … right in your own living room.  Lucas Frank knows the cost of hunting human monsters. That’s why he left Boston  for the peace of the Michigan woods. But a tantalizing case has lured the forensic  psychiatrist back to work — and straight into the path of a cold-bloodedkiller.  Felix Zrbny was just a teenager when he went on a murder spree that left three women  dead. Now, after spending fifteen years locked away, Felix has escaped — and he is  determined to finish what he started all those years ago.  Lucas races to untangle  the mysteries of Felix’s mind as the ratings-hungry press steps in to make Felix  its own macabre media darling. They track his every move and broadcast his bloody  reign of terror for the whole world to see. And all the while, behind the scenes,  someone is orchestrating the moment when the killer and the hunter will at last come  face-to-face.  They say everyone gets their fifteen minutes of fame. For Felix Zrbny,  it’s fifteen minutes of infamy. The clock is ticking — and he’s going to make sure  that every minute counts.From the Paperback edition.

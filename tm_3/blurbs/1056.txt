The heart has consistently captured the human imagination. It has been singled out as a cultural icon, the repository of our deepest religious and artistic impulses, the organ whose steady functioning is understood, both literally and symbolically, as the very life force itself.  The Sublime Engine will explore the profound sense of awe every person feels when they ponder the miracle encased within their ribs. In this lyrical history of our most essential organ, a critically-acclaimed novelist and a leading cardiologist–who happen to be brothers–draw upon history, science, religion, popular culture, and literature to illuminate all of the heart’s physical and figurative chambers. Each of the four sections– The Ancient Heart, The Renaissance Heart, The Modern Heart, and The Future Heart–will focus on a major epoch in our understanding of the heart and the hidden history of cardiology. Erudite, witty, and enthralling, The Sublime Engine makes the heart come alive for readers.

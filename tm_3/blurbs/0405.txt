Time travel runs amok as Pigsticks and his loyal sidekick commandeer a faulty time machine, catching comical glimpses of history along the way.Pigsticks aspires to be a brilliant inventor like his great-aunt Ada Lovepig, and the Tuptown Science Fair would be the perfect showcase for his skills — except his spaceship invention is a mess, and it’s already the day of the competition. He needs more time! Luckily, his great-aunt Ada happens to have left behind an intact time machine, and fueled by the thought of future cakes not yet invented, Harold signs on for another Pigsticks scheme. When the lever breaks on the time machine, however, Pigsticks and Harold are catapulted back and forth through history — way back to the era of the dinopigs, ahead to the building of the Statue of Pigerty in New York, back to ancient Rome and its famous Julius Squealer — with no way to make the traveling stop, and with dangerous moments at every turn. Can they buy themselves enough time — and a new lever for the machine — to make it home again in one piece? Piece of cake! (They hope.)

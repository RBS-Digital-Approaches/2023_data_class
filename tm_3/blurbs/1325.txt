“One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . . Simenon was unequaled at making us look inside, though the ability was masked by his brilliance at absorbing us obsessively in his stories.” —The GuardianGeorges Simenon’s thoughtful mystery set in a tranquil town on the Dutch coast“‘Just take a look,’ Duclos said in an undertone, pointing to the  scene all round them, the picture-book town, with everything in its  place, like ornaments on the mantlepiece of a careful housewife. . . . ‘Everyone here earns his living. Everyone’s more or less content. And  above all, everyone keeps his instincts under control, because that’s  the rule here, and a necessity if people want to live in society.’”When  a French professor visiting the quiet Dutch coastal town of Delfzjil  is accused of murder, Maigret is sent to investigate. The community appears happy to blame an unknown outsider, but there are people much closer to  home who seem to know much more than they’re letting on: Beetje, the  dissatisfied daughter of a local farmer, Any van Elst, sister-in-law of  the deceased, and a notorious local crook.

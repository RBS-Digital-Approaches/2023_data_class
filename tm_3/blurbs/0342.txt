You’re no idiot, of course. You know Heisenburg’s uncertainty principle has nothing to do with where you put your car keys. But modern cosmology is relatively complicated. The mystery of the universe definitely isn’t one we can flip to the end to see whodunit.  That hasn’t stopped physicists, astronomers, and philosophers from searching for clues! The topic is infinite (literally), but once you’ve read this book, you’ll have a solid idea of our place in the universe—and even where the cosmos itself might be headed. In this Complete Idiot’s Guide®, you’ll explore:   • Major religions, philosophical, and scientific theories concerning the nature and origin of the universe.   • “The theory of everything”—one coherent model that would explain how all the forces and particles of nature work.   • The fascinating and even sometimes bizarre implications of the latest theories.

A life of wholeness and purpose are well within our reach–The Art of Abundance outlines ten rules, or practices, that lay the foundation for a life worth living.Whether we’re striving for a new job, a higher salary, or a stronger relationship, Dennis Merritt Jones explains in The Art of Abundance that we all essentially want the same things: freedom, inner peace, and a life filled with purpose and meaning. He shows that a life of wholeness and peaceful satisfaction is readily available to us–we just need the eyes to see it and the faith to claim it. The problem is that most people don’t know where to look for such a life. This book will help readers open their eyes to the limitless abundance that lies waiting just beyond their current belief system.     In The Art of Abundance, Jones identifies ten rules, or practices that, when followed faithfully, lay the foundation for a life worth living. In order to make each rule as easy to apply as possible, Jones lays out the premise, the problem, the principle, the practice, and the payoff of each. These practices assist readers in creating a greater flow of goodness into their lives–in ways they may have never considered.

This collection, available exclusively as an ebook, brings together two tales of Highclere Castle, the grand estate that serves as the central character for the hit PBS show Downton Abbey, from the current Countess of Carnarvon. A New York Times bestseller, Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey contrasts the splendor of Edwardian life in a great house against the backdrop of the First World War and offers an inspiring and revealing picture of Lady Almina, the woman at the center of the history of Highclere Castle. Lady Catherine, the Earl, and the Real Downton Abbey transports readers to the 1920s and 1930s as the nations of Europe inched towards war and tells the story of Catherine Wendell, the beautiful and spirited American woman who married Lady Almina’s son, the man who would become the 6th Earl of Carnarvon. Using copious materials—including diaries and scrapbooks—from the castle’s archives, the current Countess of Carnarvon brings these stories to life in a beautiful and fabled setting.

Based on a popular New York Times Op-Ed piece, this is the quirky, heartfelt account of one man’s quest to meet his neighbors–and find a sense of community. **As seen in Parade, USA Today, The Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, and more.**Winner of the Zocalo Square Book Prize, and recently named a first selection by Action Book Club. “It’s impossible to read this book without feeling the urge to knock on neighbors’ doors.” –Chicago Sun-Times Journalist and author Peter Lovenheim lived on the same street in suburban Rochester, NY, most of his life. But it was only after a brutal murder-suicide rocked the community that he was struck by a fact of modern life in this comfortable enclave: No one knew anyone else.  Thus begins Peter’s search to meet and get to know his neighbors. An inquisitive person, he does more than just introduce himself. He asks, ever so politely, if he can sleep over.  In this smart, engaging, and deeply felt book, Lovenheim takes readers inside the homes, minds, and hearts of his neighbors and asks a thought-provoking question: Do neighborhoods matter–and is something lost when we live among strangers?

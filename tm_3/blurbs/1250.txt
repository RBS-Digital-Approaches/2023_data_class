Featuring luxurious concoctions ranging from ancient Latin American originals and European café classics to comforting childhood treats. No longer just a simple, syrupy sweet drink, today’s hot chocolates are brimming with extraordinary flavors like cayenne, vanilla beans, Nutella, buttered rum, pistachios, wasabi, peanut butter, and malted milk balls. Featuring white chocolate foam, marshmallow cream, and frozen and fondue versions, the 60 recipes presented in Hot Chocolate are setting trends in haute chocolate consumption. Contributed by the world’s preeminent chocolatiers, including Vosges Haut-Chocolat, Serendipity 3, Citizen Cake, Fran’s Chocolates, Scharffen Berger Chocolate, and many more, these imaginative modern variations are for the hip chocoholic of any age.    A cup of hot chocolate is twice as rich in antioxidants as a glass of red wine. And, some would say, is just as intoxicating.

A user-friendly guide for students of anatomy and anyone interested in the workings of the human bodyThis concise, pocket-sized reference guide is a handy, comprehensive reference for students and practitioners of anatomy, massage, physical therapy, chiropractics, medicine, and physiotherapy–or for anyone who would like a quick and well-organized manual of human anatomy. The first seven chapters explain anatomical orientation, tissues, bone, the axial and appendicular skeletons, joints, and skeletal muscle and fascia. In the book’s final chapters, the muscle groups of the body’s four major regions are amply illustrated, with composite drawings detailing each region’s deep and superficial muscles in both anterior and posterior views. Color tables show each muscle’s origin, insertion, innervation, and action. Written in clear, accessible prose, the book offers a wealth of knowledge to the lay reader, the aficionado, or the practitioner.

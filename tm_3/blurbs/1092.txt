It’s Kae, again! After the heart stopping showdown between the Mutsumi Brothers, things looked like they might finally settle down again, but a bold confession from Mutsumi-senpai spurs all the boys into action!It’s like a real life otome game as everyone tries to plan the best romantic afternoon, but it’s so much pressure to choose, much less think about having a boyfriend! Especially when there are bigger problems to worry about…Shima-chan and I are all fired up about a new anime that’s perfect for us fujoshi, but we end up not seeing eye to eye! Can a friendship build on boys’ love survive a vicious shipping war?!Now an anime from the studio that made PRINCESS JELLYFISH and MY LITTLE MONSTER!

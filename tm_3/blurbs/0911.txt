Meet Rocket and his teacher, the little yellow bird, in this two-book boxed set, which is perfect for young readers-in-the-making. In the New York Times bestselling book, How Rocket Learned to Read, Rocket learns the sounds of each letter, sounds out words, and listens excitedly to storybooks. Then, in the irresistible sequel, Rocket Writes a Story, Rocket collects new words for his word tree, seaches for inspiration, writes—and rewrites—every day, and, finally, shares his story with a new friend. These books—plus a word tree poster for display—are a winning combination, sure to appeal to kids, parents, teachers, and librarians.

Booker Prize-winning author John Berger gives a novel both tragic and joyous, intelligent and erotic. In To the Wedding, a blind Greek peddler tells the story of the wedding between a fellow peddler and his bride in a remarkable series of vivid and telling vignettes. As the book cinematically moves from one character’s perspective to another, events and characters move toward the convergence of the wedding–and a haunting dance of love and death.

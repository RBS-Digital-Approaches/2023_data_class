Nick and his friends have everything: expensive clothes, beautiful apartments, rich friends. The island of Manhattan is at their feet. But underneath this picture-perfect world of private schools and private parties lies a gang world filled with drinking, drugs, casual sex, and graffiti. And Nick wants out. He’s had enough of the life, and he’s in love with his best friend, Kris, even though she’s oblivious to his feelings. When Kris’s younger brother becomes a gang target, Nick thinks he can help, even if it means putting his own life at risk.

Ollie is a purple elephant who is lost and has no place to call home.  Until Shelby and Peter find him in the park—and invite him to live with them.  Soon Ollie is a regular part of the family.  He doesn’t have a room to call his own, but he doesn’t mind. He is happy.  He loves hopscotch and kickball—but most of all he loves the dance parties the McLaughlins have after dinner.But Mr. Puddlebottom, the downstairs neighbor, most certainly does not love Ollie.  And neither does the McLaughlins’ cat, Ginger.  Ollie has taken her spot on the couch at night.  When the conspirators hatch a plan to get rid of Ollie, the purple elephant walks right into their trap—and onto a circus cart.  Will he ever be reunited with his family?

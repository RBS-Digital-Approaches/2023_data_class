When Lisa’s baby sister arrives, everyone makes a big fuss–everyone but Lisa. Grandma is all excited, Dad can’t snap enough photos, Lisa’s big sister Victoria has to show off the baby to all of her friends, and of course, Mom is always busy feeding the baby or changing her diaper. No one pays much attention to Lisa, even when she plays her flute very loudly just outside the baby Lila’s room. But then someone proclaims that this very cute little baby looks just like Lisa! And it isn’t long before Lisa becomes a proud big sister.

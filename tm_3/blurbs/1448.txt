A crash of rhinos, a zeal of zebras, or a pandemonium of parrots … ever wonder what you call that group of animals? Fantastic photography from award-winning photographer Frans Lanting introduces young children to animal groups — their names, behaviors, and distinctive features. From the African savanna to an island off of Iceland, kids find adorable close-up shots and spectacular sweeping vistas of massive migrating herds. Playful text and design make the book a read-aloud treat that will have kids wondering what discovery they’ll make next and parents trying to recall what on Earth you call a group of hyenas (it’s a cackle, of course!).

The world’s greatest paranormal investigator meets the world’s greatest paranormal! Word at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense says there’s a ghost in Arcadia. A ghost that hunts. A ghost that kills people. Not the kind that pushes you down a flight of stairs or grabs the wheel when you’re driving &mdash; the kind that cuts you in half with a pair of .45 automatics. If she’s a ghost &mdash; a “real” ghost &mdash; then she’s one of a kind, and the Bureau wants her. And if anyone can get her, you can bet it’s Hellboy . . .

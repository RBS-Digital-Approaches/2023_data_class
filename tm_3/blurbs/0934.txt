As the first European to travel extensively throughout Asia, Marco Polo was the earliest  bridge between East and West. His famous journeys took him across the boundaries  of the known world, along the dangerous Silk Road, and into the court of Kublai Kahn,  where he won the trust of the most feared and reviled leader of his day. Polo introduced  the cultural riches of China to Europe, spawning centuries of Western fascination  with Asia. In this lively blend of history, biography, and travelogue, acclaimed  author Laurence Bergreen separates myth from history, creating the most authoritative  account yet of Polo’s remarkable adventures.  Exceptionally narrated and written  with a discerning eye for detail, Marco Polo is as riveting as the life it describes.

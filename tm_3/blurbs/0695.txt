"Young and old alike will easily embrace Oxenbury’s Alice, who seems  both old-fashioned and modern, and comfortable in worlds on both sides of the mirror." — BOOKLIST (starred review)Helen Oxenbury’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland set a new standard for contemporary editions of Lewis Carroll’s beloved classic, and this companion is illustrated with equal intimacy, warmth, and charm. Here again is Alice, dressed in her bright blue jumper and ready for adventure. All it takes is a bit of curiosity about the world reversed in the mirror, and suddenly Alice is interacting with all manner of comical and magical characters — Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the lion and the unicorn, and a game board of chess pieces come to life. Helen Oxenbury’s incomparable line drawings, sepia illustrations, and full-color paintings give today’s children an accessible view into Lewis Carroll’s timeless nonsense.

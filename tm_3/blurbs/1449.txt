Never Shake Hands with a War Criminal is a personal and political history told with acid humor and a loving heart. Barry Crimmins, a writer and commentator on Air America Radio, travels from a skeptical childhood in frozen upstate New York, through the founding of the Boston comedy scene, to a career as a satirist and activist. No villain is spared; no hero is forgotten. Crimmins also cuts a hilarious swath through our political tormentors, in the spirit of Mark Twain, Will Rogers, and Lenny Bruce.

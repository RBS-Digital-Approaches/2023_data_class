Tulip and Snuggle like to sing rabbit songs and play rabbit games when their owners, Grace and Peter, are away. One day Tulip figures out how to open their cage, and then the fun begins! First the rabbits are happy to simply explore they house but soon they are completing household chores so the family will have more time to spend with them. Washing the dishes, folding the laundry, making a tuna casserole-no task is too large for these big-hearted bunnies.

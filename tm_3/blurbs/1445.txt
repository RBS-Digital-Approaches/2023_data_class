With   a scientist’s mind and an animal lover’s compassion, world-renowned   biologist Rupert Sheldrake presents a groundbreaking exploration of   animal behavior that will profoundly change the way we think about   animals–and ourselves.How do cats know when it’s  time to go to the vet, even before the cat carrier comes out? How do  dogs know when their owners are returning home at unexpected times? How  can horses find their way back to the stable over completely unfamiliar  terrain?After five years of extensive research involving  thousands of people who have pets and work with animals, Dr. Sheldrake  proves conclusively what many pet owners already know: there is a strong  connection between humans and animals that defies present-day  scientific understanding. Sheldrake compellingly demonstrates that we and our pets are social animals linked together by invisible bonds connecting animals to each other, to their owners, and to their homes in powerful ways. His provocative ideas about these social, or morphic, fields explain the uncanny behavior often observed in pets and help provide an explanation for amazing animal behavior in the wild, such as migration and homing.Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home not only provides fascinating insight into animal, and human, behavior, but also teaches us to question the boundaries of conventional scientific thought, and shows that the very animals who are closest to us have much to teach us about biology, nature, and consciousness.

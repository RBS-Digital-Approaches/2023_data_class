The jungle is a noisy place. The elephants BOOM, the rhinos BAM-BAM, the hornbills CAW-CAW and the apes HOO-HAA. But Tapir and Little Tapir don’t make a sound. They tiptoe through their days — until the morning a hungry leopard forces them to run for the lives. Leopard is just about to pounce when BANG! The sound of a hunter’s gun stops all three animals in their tracks. Now Leopard must flee — very quietly, with help from the tapirs. From that day on, Leopard moves with a very soft step as do the rest of the jungle beasts. With elegant pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations, this original pourquoi story is a satisfying and visually arresting tale of quiet rewarded.

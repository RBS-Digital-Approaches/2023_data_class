What do Neil Diamond, Touched by an Angel, Pamela Anderson, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, White castle hamburgers, Benny Hill, Thomas Kinkade, and the song “You Light Up My Life” have in common? They’re all guilty pleasures—and they’re all celebrated in this massive A-to-Z encyclopedia.   Authors Sam Stall, Lou Harry, and Julia Spalding have unearthed fascinating trivia about literature (Valley of the Dolls, The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue), television (The Real World, Land of the Lost), fashion (Members Only jackets, the WonderBra), and more. Every page features a sophisticated two-column design and handy guide words for quick at-a-glance reference. Best of all, we’ve illustrated 100 of the guiltiest pleasures with the same portrait style used by the Wall Street Journal.   Complete with 1,001 entries, it’s the ultimate guide to everything you hate to love!

Danny Dragonbreath has seen a lot of weird things, but nothing quite like the inside of his best friend Wendell’s brain. Wendell has been having terrible nightmares, and Danny and Wendell’s totally-not-girlfriend Suki agree to venture into the iguana’s mind to get rid of the thing causing the dreams–before Wendell goes permanently insane. There’s more scary stuff in Wendell’s strange and nerdy subconscious than Danny bargained for, and getting out of there is no easy feat, even for a ninja girl and an almost-fire-breathing dragon.The eighth book in the smoking hot Dragonbreath series for fans of Diary of a Wimpy Kid , Bad Kitty, and Big Nate will make you laugh until smoke comes out your nose!

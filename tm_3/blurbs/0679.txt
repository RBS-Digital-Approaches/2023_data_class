There’s a bowling alley in the basement, chefs are always available to prepare whatever you’re craving, and sometimes presidential aides will even help you with your homework!

For every perk, there’s a problem. From Washington to Obama, see the White House through the eyes of the children and grandchildren. Filled with wacky, weird, and wonderful stories, it shows what it’s like to call the president Dad (or Granddad or Uncle). Find out what schools they went to, what mischief they caused, and what pets they had. There are first-person accounts from letters and interviews, fascinating photos, original illustrations, and even a section that follows the children after they left the White House.From the Hardcover edition.

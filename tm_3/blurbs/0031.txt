Small WondersComing home to Bethlehem in hand-cuffs isn’t the way Cole Jackson’s life was supposed to turn out. Now, trapped in the last place on earth he wants to be, he’s facing serious jail time…and the woman and kids who are both better off without him. Once Cole thought sexy single mother Leanne Wilson could make a new man of him…until he walked away from the tantalizing promise of a future together. But seeing her again rekindles the kind of passion that could set one lifelong sinner on the rocky road to redemption.Liar. Schemer. Heartbreaker. Sure, Leanne knows Cole Jackson. Everyone knows how he cheated the good folk of Bethlehem, then skipped town, leaving Leanne to pick up the pieces. She swore she’d never forgive him, but something’s happened since Bethlehem’s bad boy returned. Maybe it’s those five thousand hours of community service that are slowly turning the town Cole’s way. Or maybe it’s how he’s seducing her all over again with a passion that makes her yearn for forever with the man who could be her last, best mistake…

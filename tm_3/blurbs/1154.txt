In the Secrets of the Vine Bible Study, Bruce Wilkinson shows groups or individual readers how the three Secrets of the Vine introduced in the bestselling book are supported throughout Scripture, applying sound biblical insight to help them move toward making maximum impact for God. This Bible study provides a personal encounter with the life-changing teaching of Jesus in John 15, an inspiring look at God’s intervention in His children’s lives from Bible times to the present, a practical approach to a meaningful relationship with Him, and a visual and interactive learning tool for individual or group use.

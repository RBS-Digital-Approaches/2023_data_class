Equal parts cute, silly, and subversive, this four-panel comedy manga is great for fans of anarchic slice-of-life gag manga like Nichijou and Azumanga Daioh. Anime adaptation coming 2017!Yoshiko Saves Christmas Yoshiko isn’t merely stupid. She isn’t just a fool. Her foolishness transcends boundaries and borders–she is a genius, a savant of stupidity. Her ability is so profound it can make the simplest activity–reading comics with a friend–into a lascivious voyage into the heart of darkness. Or maybe she’s just not very good at reading. The point is, just don’t tell her that Santa doesn’t exist. She might resort to drastic measures.

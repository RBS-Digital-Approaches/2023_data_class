Small kid. Big Stage.Does EllRay have a talent to put on show for the entire school?When EllRay and his friends hear about the school talent show, they’re not impressed. They’re too old for that stuff. But their teacher, Mrs. Sanchez, isn’t so quick to let her students off the hook. Five students absolutely must try-out, and EllRay somehow ends up being one of them. Now he has to figure out something he’s talented at….like, maybe magic?But now the pressure’s on. It’s up to EllRay to take the stage and show his classmates and the whole school that he’s not only talented but magic.

Judy Sierra, author of the award-winning bestseller Wild About Books, and J. Otto Seibold of Olive, the Other Reindeer fame use the familiar storybook character B(ig) B(ad) Wolf, who is now retired and residing at Villian Villa Senior Center,  to create a funny original story. Very young children will delight in seeing this all-star cast of storybook characters–the three pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, the Gingerbread Boy, and others–interacting with B.B. Wolf in an entirely new, funny, and helpful story about knowing when to say “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me.” As she did in her E. B. White Read-Aloud Award winner Wild About Books, Judy Sierra has written a story that begs to be read aloud.

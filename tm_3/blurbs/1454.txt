In his powerful bestseller The Soul’s Code, James Hillman brilliantly illuminated the central importance of character to our spiritual and emotional lives. Now, in this magnificent new book, Hillman completes his exploration of character with a profound and revolutionary reflection on life’s second half."Character requires the additional years," declares Hillman. "The last years confirm and fulfill character." Far from blunting or dulling the self, the accumulation of experience concentrates the essence of our being, heightening our individual mystery and unique awareness of life. Drawing on his grounding in Jungian psychology, Hillman explains here the archetypes and myths that govern the self’s realignment in our final years.The Force of Character follows an enriching journey through the three stages of aging–lasting, the deepening that comes with longevity; leaving, the preparation for departure; and left, the special legacy we each bestow on our survivors.  Along the way the book explores the meanings and often hidden virtues of characteristic physical and emotional changes, such as loss of memory, alterations in sleep patterns, and the mysterious upsurge in erotic imagination.Steeped in the wisdom of a lifetime, radiant with Hillman’s reading in philosophy, poetry, and sacred texts, charged with a piercing clarity, The Force of Character is a book that will change–and affirm–the lives of all who read it.

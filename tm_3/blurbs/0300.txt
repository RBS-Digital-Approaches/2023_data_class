In this unique series the Civil War comes vividly to life.  Here an eyewitness accounts–many available for the first time in decades–by generals, journalist, and ordinary foot soldiers, both blue and gray, who relive the conflict in all its terrible glory.  Each volume brings you a human perspective on the war–its most decisive battles, its most remarkable personalities. Gettysburg: Two Eyewitness Accounts is American history at its finest–and a reading experience you will never forget.  In some ways it epitomized the entire war: three hot days in July filled with missed opportunities, great courage, inconsistent leadership, and horrific, relentless carnage.  In rare volume we see the battle from both sides, as experienced by two very different combatants, one Union and the other Confederate.  From Little Round Top to Devil’s Den to Pickett’s Charge, Lt. Frank A. Haskell and Col. William C. Oates, one in a meticulous hindsight and the other still feverish with war, re-create three days that changed American history.  Here are the momentous decisions of Lee, Longstreet, and Meade.  Here are the fatal maneuverings of the forces in the field.  And here, in descriptions unmatched in Civil War literature, is all the heartbreak and triumph of Gettysburg.

This is the original classic about Short Form, the most popular and widespread form of T’ai Chi in the West. T’ai Chi Ch’uan is a must-read for every serious T’ai Chi student. This book is not meant to "teach" T’ai Chi Ch’uan, but meant to expound upon its meaning to the earnest practitioner; to offer the layperson a glimpse into this ancient art; and to communicate the author’s unique perceptions and experiences that only a lifetime of practice can cultivate. Taken in this context, this is a most valuable book.

In her cashmere sweater, suede pumps, and pearls, Lilly Bennett hardly looks like a hard-boiled private detective. But Lilly, a federal marshal and part-time P.I., has a sharp eye for shady doings among the Wyoming moneyed circles in which she moves. And her Glock .26 makes the perfect accessory with any outfit….Even Lilly admits that the week of her wedding is not the ideal time to take on a case, but this one’s a little personal. During a round of prenuptial parties, a gunshot cuts down the hostess at her own soiree–just minutes after Lilly left her side. Lilly is determined to catch a killer and make it to the church on time. The only question is whether she’ll be sporting a wedding veil…or a satin-lined casket.From the Paperback edition.

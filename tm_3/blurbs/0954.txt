In this seductive novel of corporate affairs, a sexy new VP proves that business and pleasure mix deliciously well.   When Charity Brown accidentally catches a glimpse of the sexiest man on earth naked, the image is difficult—make that impossible—to forget. But he also happens to be her company’s new vice president, and he’s chosen her to be his second in command. He may wear tailored suits, but Jake Halford is all male—rugged and real, with a seductive charm that’s almost too hot to handle.   Jake wants Charity from the moment he sees her, but the urge to possess this woman goes deeper than a fling. He’s a man who understands and craves the primal bond of a soulmate, and he knows that Charity may be his own. But as corporate warfare forces them to take a stand on the issues that divide them, will their fragile new love be able to weather the storm?   Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: Taking Shots, Along Came Trouble, and Hell on Wheels.

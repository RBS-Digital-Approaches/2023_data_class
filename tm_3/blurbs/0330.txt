A comprehensive, communicative, and practical guide to using  Japanese, Kodansha’s Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary is an  invaluable reference tool for anyone with an interest in the Japanese  language. It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in  mind students, teachers, business people, and casual linguists.What is furigana and why is it so important?Furigana  refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to  show the pronunciation of the Chinese character. With furigana  superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is  able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance.  Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings  or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the  past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using  textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing  number of influential curriculums around the world are based on a  rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and  katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers studying  under such curriculums will inevitably feel more comfortable with a  dictionary such as Kodansha’s Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary, one  that shows the pronunciation of kanji with familiar and authentic kana  script.FEATURES•     More than 14,000 entries comprising the most commonly used words in English•     Furigana pronunciation guides added to all kanji •     Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions explained clearly in English •     Thousands of full-length example sentences illustrate typical usage in natural Japanese •     Idioms, phrases, and common expressions help expand vocabulary and sentence building skills •     Many encyclopedic entries offer useful background information on Japanese history and culture •     Includes many current terms such as artificial intelligence and internet •     Hundreds of scientific and medical terms with full Japanese equivalentsWith  its sister publication, Kodansha’s Furigana Japanese-English  Dictionary, this dictionary makes the perfect reference for all students  of Japanese.

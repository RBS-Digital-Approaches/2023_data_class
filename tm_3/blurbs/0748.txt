As inspiring as The Last Lecture, an unforgettable memoir that reminds us all to live each day with adventure and joyFor Kate Greene, nothing was as important as her two little boys, Reef and Finn, and her loving husband, St. John, known as “Singe.” Together, they shared a wonderfully happy family life—until Kate was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer. During her final days, Kate created what she called Mum’s List. She included simple things like “look for four-leaf clovers” and “take them for walks along mummy’s favorite beach.” The list became Singe’s rock. Mom’s List is the book that Singe never wanted to write, but—in sharing the wisdom and inspiration that buoyed him during his darkest hours—he pays tribute to his beloved wife and the life she dreamed of for their sons after she was gone.

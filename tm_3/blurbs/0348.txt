What follows are government agents, German spies,  deception, danger, and adventure. This is the world of… The Rocketeer! Dave Stevens’ high-soaring pulp-inspired character was an instant classic when first released. Now, for the first time, all The Rocketeer stories by Stevens are collected in one edition–and all meticulously remastered and re-colored–bringing the complete death-defying adventures of Cliff Secord and company to a brand new audience!

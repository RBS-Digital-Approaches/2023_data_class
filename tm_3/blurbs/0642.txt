Stanley’s brothers and sisters want to play soccer or jump-rope or bouncing, but Grandpa and Stanley aren’t too good at those games. What they do have a special talent for is snuggling, as they discover when Stanley sings Grandpa a song, and they both fall asleep. No wonder Stanley loves his grandpa the best of all!

Dawn Powell had a brilliant mind and  a keen wit and her humor was never at a finer pitch than in her diaries. And yet  her story is a poignant one – a son emotionally and mentally impaired, a household  of too much alcohol and never enough money, and an artistic career that, if not a  failure, fell far short of the success she craved. All is recorded here – along with  working sketches for her novels, and often revealing portraits of her many friends  (a literary who’s who of her period) – in her always unique style and without self-delusion.Powell’s remarkable  Diaries will stand as one of her finest literary achievements.

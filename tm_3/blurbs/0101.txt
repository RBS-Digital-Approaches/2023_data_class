RETURN TO WORLD OF WARFARE! After  an intense World of Warfare (WOW) bender, college kid and hardcore  gamer Shesh Maccabee finds himself completely consumed by his dark  character, slayer extraordinaire Moggrathka. To avoid a repeat  incident—and the potentially fatal consequences of getting whacked  online—Shesh enmeshes himself in the real world with the help of a  part-time job, focusing on paying tuition instead of slaying orcs.  Meanwhile his archenemy, student cop Rona, is never far behind, watching  and waiting for Shesh to lapse back into character and go on a rampage.Before  you know it, he does just that, wreaking havoc across the WOW servers .  . . and across campus. With Shesh’s RPG-enabling gamemaster friend Theo  feeding the fires of madness, WOW execs devise a plan to extinguish  Moggrathka’s virtual flame once and for all. The final showdown explodes  at the world’s biggest WOW convention, where top gamers gather to fight  for supremacy. It’s the ultimate battle between good, evil, and chaotic  evil with the (virtual) lives of millions at stake!

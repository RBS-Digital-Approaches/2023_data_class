This engrossing popular astronomy book is written specifically for those who have always been intrigued by or have been developing a growing interest in astronomy and space, but have had little time to explore the amazing world of exploding stars, distant galaxies, rovers on other planets, and more. The book consists of three sections: Questions and Answers, Quick Facts, and A Brief History of Lunar and Planetary Exploration.Knocke — who has often lectured at the prestigious Mount Wilson and Lowell Observatories — provides answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding astronomy, outer space, and space exploration in the Questions and Answers section. She gives simple and easy-to-understand answers to such provocative questions as: “What is a blue moon?” “Could you travel through a black hole?” “Is the North Star the brightest star in the sky?” “Is Pluto really a planet?”The Quick Facts section offers the reader an easy way to look up fascinating statistics about the moon and planets, bright stars, constellations, and more. This section also includes a guide to upcoming meteor showers and lunar and solar eclipses.A Brief History of Lunar and Planetary Exploration includes a chronological listing of every mission that has been launched to the moon and planets. By listing both the successes and failures, readers gain a better understanding of just how difficult it is to travel beyond our own planet.This generously illustrated volume also includes a color insert containing, among other pictures, beautiful images of Saturn from the Cassini spacecraft, currently in orbit around the planet. Whether read from cover to cover or used as a reference tool to search for specific answers, From Blue Moons to Black Holes will prove to be fun, accessible, and wonderfully thought provoking.

In this “devilishly clever, scintillatingly sexy paranormal series,”(Chicago Tribune) New York Times bestselling author Christina Dodd introduces the Wilder brothers—and the evil that’s haunted their family for centuries. Finally, here is the missing link that could redeem them… Brutally handsome cop Doug Black is determined to find the birth family who left him with nothing but a terrifying inheritance: the ability to change into a savage golden cougar. His search leads him to a woman as dauntless and exotic as her name. Firebird Wilder is bitterly familiar with supernatural gifts, and flees on discovering his secret, leaving Doug alone once more. But no one can escape a wild cougar on the hunt. When he finds her, they both must decide which is more powerful—the love that binds them together…or the secrets that threaten to tear them apart.

Half birthdays are a whole lot of fun!Max wants to have a party, but it isn’t his birthday. So Grandma comes up with a great idea: They’ll celebrate his half birthday instead! Complete with cupcakes (cut in half) and paper hats (also halved), the festivities finish with everyone singing “Happy Half Birthday to You!”

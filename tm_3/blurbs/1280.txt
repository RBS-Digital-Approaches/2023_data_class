The winner of this year’s Best Classroom contest will represent the school on a reality show, but what chance does Room 207 have to win when it is already nicknamed, “The Pigpen”? And how do you accept an award if your teacher has been swallowed by slime?Room 207’s cast of hilarious characters includes a guinea pig named Butterbum, a cat who needed ten lives and nine kids desperate to prove themselves to the school and to the reality-tv viewing world.

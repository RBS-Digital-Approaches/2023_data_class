The unforgettable sequel to Karleen Koen’s beloved debut, Through a Glass DarklyA Book-of-the-Month Club main selectionA bride at ﬁfteen, widowed at the tender age of twenty, Barbara, Countess Devane, embarks for colonial Virginia ﬁnancially ruined by the death of her husband in scandalous circumstances. Dressed in mourning as is proper for a woman, she is patronizingly described as a “fragile black butterfly,” but the fragility is deceiving. She makes a place for herself in the new world, takes lovers and friends across political divides, and questions the established traditions of slavery. Facing enemies she never suspected, she must return to England and deal face to face with the problems created by her husband, who haunts her even in death. Back in London, she quickly ﬁnds herself pulled into Jacobite plotting, and the treachery of powerful men suddenly threatens her family, her friends—and a new love.Now Face to Face sweeps readers from eighteenth-century America to London and brings both worlds to vivid life. It is a magniﬁcent evocation of an era, from the plantations of Virginia to Hanoverian England.

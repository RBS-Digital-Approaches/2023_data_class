A very up-to-the-minute novel with the taboo-busting confidence of modern horror’s finest, delivered with the blissful pace of a techno-thriller…SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS DEAD. When she woke up in the hospital, she could barely remember getting on the flight, let alone the terrorist bomb of which she was the only survivor. But she can hear the voices in her head, for they are the spirits of the dead passengers. They cannot rest until they have delivered their terrifying message: the terrorists know she survived. And they’re coming for her!Fle Under: Horror [ Explosions  | The FBI Lie | Voices Of The Dead | The Anti-Christ ]

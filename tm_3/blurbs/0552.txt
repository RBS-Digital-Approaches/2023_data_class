When is a relationship too close, and when is it not close enough? How intimate can or should be the relationship between therapist and client, doctor and patient, supervisor and trainee? These questions of pressing concern—especially where power imbalances and ethical issues complicate relationships—are addressed by Joseph L. Henderson, June Singer, Peter Rutter, Montague Ullman, Diane Wood Middlebrook, Harry A. Wilmer, and eight other writers. Includes a foreword by Maya Angelou.

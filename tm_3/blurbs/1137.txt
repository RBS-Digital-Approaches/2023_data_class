Neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of night kept this poch from his appointed rounds! Back in the 1880s, when the Old West boomed with the rush for gold and silver, the miners of Calico, California, needed a mail carrier they could count on.  And they found him in a Border collie named Dorsey.  Based on the true story of the most celebrated canine mail carrier in U.S. history, Calico Dorsey tells the tale of a winsome stray who found both a home and a calling on the mining trails of the Old West.An Author’s Note includes a photograph of the real-life Dorsey, as well as historical information about the dog and the mining town he called home.

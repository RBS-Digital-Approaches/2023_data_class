How Charles Darwin saw the world changed it forever. Creation: The True Story of Charles Darwin is now a major motion picture.In a chest of drawers bequeathed by his grandmother, author Randal Keynes discovered the writing case of Charles and Emma Darwin’s beloved daughter Annie Darwin, who died at the age of ten. In it were the notes Darwin kept throughout Annie’s illness. Together with his deeply moving memorial of her, they provide a key to a provocative look into Darwin’s views on nature, evolution, and the human condition. Creation gives us fresh insight into the private life of a man who viewed the world in a new and extraordinary way.

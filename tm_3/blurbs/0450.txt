The rabbit ronin faces a horde of the undead when a  harmless-looking but powerful charm brings a betrayed army back to life.  With hundreds of zombies and an evil wizard to contend with, Usagi  finds himself far out of his depth! Fortunately, he has the aid of  fan-favorite character Sasuké the Demon Queller, most recently seen in  the Yokai graphic novel. This volume also features several  action-packed short stories, including the Eisner-nominated “Death of  Lord Hikiji”! Collects Usagi Yojimbo #117–#123 and stories from Dark Horse Maverick 2001 and MySpace Dark Horse Presents #35.

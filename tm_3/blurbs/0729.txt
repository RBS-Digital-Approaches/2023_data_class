Climate change is often associated with predictions of dire calamities. But in the past, heroic individuals have stepped forward to meet even the most ominous ecological challenges. This book tells an inspirational story–a story both of pioneering environmentalists who raised our collective consciousness regarding nature’s value and heroes of today who are working to secure a sustainable future.The authors begin with the mounting evidence for climate change as seen in rising carbon dioxide levels, higher global temperatures, melting ice sheets, and sea level rise. They then review the history of the US environmental movement, focusing on the key people who changed our understanding of the human impact on our natural surroundings.  These include John James Audubon, Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, Bob Marshall, Roger Tory Peterson, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, David Brower, Barry Commoner, Donella Meadows, and many more. Turning to the present, the authors recount the activities of people currently pursuing remedies for climate change–scientists, researchers, activists, artists, and celebrities. Much of this information is based on recent personal interviews.They conclude with a set of actionable strategies, demonstrating that there are good reasons to hope that we can achieve a sustainable lifestyle, protect our planet as our home, and ensure the future for our children.

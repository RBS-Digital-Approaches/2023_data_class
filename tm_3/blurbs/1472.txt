It?s a young bear?s first autumn, and the falling leaves surprise him. He tries to put them back on the trees, but it doesn?t work. Eventually, he gets sleepy, and burrows into the fallen leaves for a long nap. When he wakes up, it?s spring?and there are suddenly brand-new leaves all around, welcoming him. Graceful illustrations and a childlike main character offer the perfect way to talk to children about the wonder of the changing seasons.

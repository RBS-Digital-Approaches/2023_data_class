Saddle up for an adventure with two sisters as they revitalize their school’s horseback riding club while also helping out at their family’s bakery in DK Adventures: Horse Club. Emma adores horses as much as she idolizes her older sister, Amanda. She dreams about riding a cinnamon-colored horse in a show alongside her one day. Emma’s wish looks like it’s about to come true — but it’s not such a smooth ride. Join Emma and Amanda at Paddock Promises’ camp and learn how to handle, groom, tack up and ride a horse, meet horses from myths and legends, plus get a recipe to bake sweet pony cupcakes in DK Adventures: Horse Club.

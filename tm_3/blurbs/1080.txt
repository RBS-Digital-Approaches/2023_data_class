After yet another night of argument turned to violence with her boyfriend, Roy, Jean knows it’s time to leave—if not for herself, then for her ten-year-old daughter, Griff. But the only place they can afford to go is Ishawooa, Wyoming, where Jean’s family is dead and her deceased husband’s father Einar wishes Jean was too.Of course, Griff knows none of this—only that here in Wyoming, with a grandfather she has never known and his crippled friend Mitch, she may finaly be able to find a home.

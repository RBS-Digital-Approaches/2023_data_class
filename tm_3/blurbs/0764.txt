There is nothing Tee enjoys more than sitting out on the porch with her great-greatmother, listening to the fascinating stories about the lucky stone.Shiny and black as night, it brought good fortune to each of its owners for over one hundred years. First it helped Mandy, a runaway slave, win her freedom. Then it saved Vashti from death by lightning at a prayer meeting. And it even saved Tee’s great-grandmother from the ferocious dancing dog and helped her meet her husband.Now Tee can’t help wondering what the old stone has in store for her. She certainly could use some luck on Valentine’s Day. But the lucky stone doesn’t belong to Tee. How can her wish come true?

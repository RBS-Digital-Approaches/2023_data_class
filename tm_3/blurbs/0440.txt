What Are Spiritual Gifts?The subject of spiritual gifts can seem complicated: Who has spiritual gifts–“”spiritual people” or everybody? What are spiritual gifts anyway?Understanding Spiritual Gifts takes you straight to God’s Word to discover answers from the Gift-Giver Himself. As you dig into Bible passages about God’s design for each of us, you’ll find out that spiritual gifts aren’t complicated–but they are life-changing. Here you will uncover what spiritual gifts are, where they come from, who has them, how they are received, and how they work within the church. As you study, you will have a new vision for how you can use your God-given gifts to bring hope to your home, your church, and a hurting world. 40 Minutes a Week Could Change Your Life!The 40-Minute Bible Studies series from the teaching team at Precept Ministries International tackles the topics that matter to you.

Now in paperback, the intimate and highly original interpretation of the life and work of Charles Darwin, by acclaimed poet and Darwinâ€™s direct descendant Ruth Padel.Padel is the great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, and in this collection of exceedingly readable, vivid verse, she brings us his life, not only following the great drama of his discovery of evolution, but also imagining the fluctuating emotions of the solitary child, the private man, and the tender father. A moving and powerful tribute, with an unquantifiable depth of family intimacy and warmth.

A Little Golden Book retelling of an all-new Thomas & Friends movie adventure about unusual new engine friends and an exciting—and scary—adventure!Train-loving boys and girls ages 3 to 7 will be riveted by this beautifully illustrated Little Golden Book retelling of an all-new Thomas & Friends movie adventure. Little Golden Books enjoy nearly 100% consumer recognition. They feature beloved characters, hot licenses, and new original stories . . . the classics of tomorrow.   In the early 1940s, a loving father crafted a small blue wooden train engine for his son, Christopher. The stories that this father, the Reverend W Awdry, made up to accompany the wonderful toy were first published in 1945 and became the basis for the Railway Series, a collection of books about Thomas the Tank Engine and his friends—and the rest is history. Thomas & Friends now make up a big extended family of engines and others on the Island of Sodor. They appear not only in books but also in television shows and movies and as a wide variety of beautifully made toys. The adventures of Thomas and his friends, which are always, ultimately, about friendship, have delighted generations of train-loving boys and girls for more than 70 years and will continue to do so for generations to come.

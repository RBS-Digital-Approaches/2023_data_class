“A very fine writer, funny, intelligent, versatile and, on occasion, unexpectedly profound.”—The Washington Post Book World“MUKHERJEE IS FEARLESS . . . DARING AND WITTY . . . Take the wild ride with Debby DiMartino from Albany to San Francisco, from lost child to masked avenger.”—The Boston Globe“POWERFULLY WRITTEN . . . Debby has no memory of her birth parents. All she knows is that she was born in a remote Indian village, the daughter of a hippie back-packing mother and a mysterious Eurasian father, both of whom have disappeared almost without a trace. . . . Her quest for her biological parents turns into an obsession. . . . Leave It to Me . . . shows Mukherjee at the peak of her craft. . . . Mixing the Greek myth of Electra with the Indian myth of Devi, she sends Devi/Debby careening down on the Bay Area like an elemental force of vengeance.”—San Francisco Chronicle“DEVI IS A BRILLIANT CREATION–hilarious, horribly knowing and even more horribly oblivious–through whom Bharati Mukherjee, with characteristic and shameless ingenuity, is laying claim to speak for an America that isn’t ‘other’ at all.”—The New York Times Book Review“STUNNING . . . An astute, ironic, and merciless insight into an aberrant version of the American dream.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)

Two brothers, masters of childhood fantastical imagination, vow to kill the bogeyman, freeing the world from half-seen monsters hiding under beds and in dark basements. Along with art-punk nihilist Joy, they journey to a world of magic where ordinary rules no longer apply&mdash;and yet their fears, and the dangers they spawn, are as real as the waking world. * New edition of the fantasy graphic novel! * Written by Ann Nocenti (Green Arrow), with art by John Bolton (Harlequin Valentine).

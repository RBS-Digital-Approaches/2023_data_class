At the same time, his twin sister, Merryn, must make her own arduous journey a step ahead of those who would gladly claim her life.

They have put in motion a deadly plan to drive Avall from the throne, destroy the power of the noble clans, and take possession of the gems themselves–all in the name of their unbending god. For Eron the choice is stark indeed: an imperfect and inexperienced king…or the tyranny of the righteous.From the Paperback edition.

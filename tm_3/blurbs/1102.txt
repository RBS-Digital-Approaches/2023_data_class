But the legendary lawman’s about to discover all that glitters is not gold—especially when it comes to a golden-haired lady rancher with a few plans of her own.   LONGARM AND THE NESTERS   At Jayhawk   Junction, Kansas, a quarrel bursts into a full-scale range war between cowmen and “nesters”—the foreign farmers fencing in the wild prairie. When Longarm steps in to broker the peace, he gets tangled up with murder, greed, and a beautiful Czarist spy.

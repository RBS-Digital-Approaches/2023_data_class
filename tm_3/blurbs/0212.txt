Jack Cole is widely acclaimed for his brilliant work on his creation, the superhero Plastic Man. But he didn’t just stretch people’s imaginations, he also frightened them out of their wits! Cole’s comics in this genre were some of the most grisly, horrifying, gut-wrenching art and stories in the history of comics! In Jack Cole’s Deadly Horror you’ll read comic stories from the 1950s with titles like “Orgy of Death,” “Hangman’s Horror,” “The Corpse That Wouldn’t Die,” “The Killer From Saturn,” “Goddess of Murder,” “Monster of the Mist,” “Dance of Death,” “The Man Who Died Twice,” “The Strangling Hands,” “Death Prowls The Streets,” “Killer From Beyond,” “A Pact With The Devil,” and many more spine-tingling tales. Introduced by Eisner Award winner and comics historian Craig Yoe with rare art and background material, this large format, full-color book is part of the acclaimed Chilling Archives of Horror Comics, which includes Dick Briefer’s Frankenstein, Bob Powell’s Terror, and Zombies! WARNING: Anti-comics crusader Dr. Fredric Wertham singled out Jack Cole art as especially harmful to impressionable minds! Jack Cole’s Deadly Horror is not recommended for the faint of heart!

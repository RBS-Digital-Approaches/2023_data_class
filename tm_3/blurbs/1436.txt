As multi-faceted as the artist herself, this stunningly illustrated book on Sophie Calle’s recent installations displays her genius for entwining personal experience with universal truth. Throughout her career, the photographer and installation artist Sophie Calle has been creating tableaux that recreate her personal journeys. Projects from the past 10 years are explored in this magnificently illustrated volume. Following on the heels of Calle’s highly acclaimed Did You See Me? this new book offers numerous images of Calle’s most recent works. Among the projects included are “The Phone Booth, Garigiliano Bridge,” which involved a public phone that Calle called at random to initiate conversations with strangers; “Take Care of Yourself,” which documents the interpretations of more than 100 women of a breakup note Calle received from a former lover; “The North Pole,” a touching tribute to the artist’s mother that imagines her realizing a lifelong dream; and the latest iteration of “What do You See,” which was created in response to one of the most brazen art heists of all time, at Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Many ongoing series are also illustrated here, including “Unfinished,” “Herein Lie Secrets,” and “Photos without Stories.” Calle’s many fans will discover how the artist continues to examine the boundaries of public and private life in ways that surprise, engage, and inspire.

Find Reality in Jesus ChristGod’s people in the Old Testament experienced only shadows of the truth about sin and salvation; their perception was dim and incomplete. But Jesus, with his once-for-all perfect sacrifice, brings the blurred shadows into focus and allows us crystal-clear understanding of God’s reality. In showing us the way to please God, the writer to the Hebrews contrasts Old Testament sacrifices with the abundant, life-changing grace available in Jesus Christ. 13 sessions for individuals or groupsFisherman Bible Studyguides include: .

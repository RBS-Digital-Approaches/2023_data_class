Hauntingly beautiful Perry McLain is desperate to escape the powerful Union Army captain who pursues her, seeking vengeance for her rebellion. Yet, her vow to save the handsome Hunter Kirkland plunges her deep into enemy territory—and into the tortuous flames of desire.  To Hunter, weak with fever, Perry is nothing but an alluring dream visiting him in the darkness, a sultry vision he could embrace only in the heat of his own imagination. Yet the memory of her warm caresses refuses to fade in the morning light.  He doesn’t realize that underneath the dirt-caked, boyish clothes of his daytime companion is the body of the woman whose nighttime passion he craves.

In the spirit of such bedtime favorites as Emily Winfield Martin’s Day Dreamers, here is a quintessential end-of-day by the beach lovingly captured and perfect for reading aloud. This simple, lyrical picture book is as warm, reassuring, and filled with joy as a vacation at the beach. Readers will join a little girl and her siblings as they wind down from a perfect day–hanging up towels, eating dinner, and getting ready for bed–each activity sparking a memory of their day–playing catch with the dog, chasing waves, and looking at sailboats along the shore. And when the lights of the family beach house go off–“In the dusky evening light, a sleepy house says goodnight”--young listeners will be lulled to sleep themselves.

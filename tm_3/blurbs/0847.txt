For the first time, paper dolls are available from the Flower Fairies(tm) Friends series. With four different fairy dolls-two boys and two girls-and eight different outfits for them to wear, young girls will love this book. The dolls and clothes are fully perforated so they’re easy to remove, and they’re printed on sturdy card stock, so the dolls and clothes will last. An envelope is conveniently attached to the inside back cover for storing the pieces.

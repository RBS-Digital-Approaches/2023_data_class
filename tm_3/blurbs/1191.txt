THE THREE EDWARDS, third in Thomas B. Costainâ€™s survey of Britain under  the Plantagenets, covers the years between 1272 and 1377 when three  Edwards ruled England. Edward I brought England out of the Middle Ages.  Edward II had a tragic reign but gave his country Edward III, who ruled  gloriously, if violently.

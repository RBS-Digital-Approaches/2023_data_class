Tomie dePaola serves as “biographer” to his delightful Italian sorceress, Strega Nona, in this beautifully drawn prequel. The tale begins with little Nona’s birth on a dark and stormy night, and ends where the original Strega Nona picks up-with Strega Nona taking on the bumbling, knock-kneed Big Anthony as an apprentice. This winsome story is illustrated throughout with Tomie dePaola’s warm and sunny watercolors! “dePaola does a splendid job of working this sparkling tale into the Strega Nona canon.” –Publishers Weekly

The third and final volume in a trilogy of prayer manuals compiled by Publishers Weekly religion editor Phyllis Tickle as a contemporary Book of Hours to guide  Christians gently yet authoritatively through the daily offices.The Divine Hours is  the first major literary and liturgical reworking of the sixth-century  Benedictine Rule of fixed-hour prayer. This beautifully conceived and  thoroughly modern three-volume guide will appeal to the theological  novice as well as to the ecclesiastical sophisticate. Making primary use  of the Book of Common Prayer and the writings of the Church Fathers, The Divine Hours is  also a companion to the New Jerusalem Bible, from which it draws its  Scripture readings.  The trilogy blends prayer and praise in a way that,  while extraordinarily fresh, respects and builds upon the ancient  wisdom of Christianity. The third and final book in the set, Prayers for Springtime,  provides prayers, psalms, and readings for this season associated with  rebirth. Compact, it is perfect for those seeking greater spiritual  depth. As a contemporary Book of Hours, The Divine Hours: Prayers for Springtime heralds  a renewal of the tradition of disciplined daily prayer, and gives those  already using the first two volumes the completion they are seeking.   With this volume, the series culminates with three prayer manuals  encompassing the liturgical and calendar year with the offices for every  day.

Little armchair travelers will be happy to join Maisy and friends on a whirlwind tour of the big city of London.It’s Maisy’s first trip to London! There are so many places to see, and so many ways to travel. Maisy and her friends visit lots of important places, like Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower of London. To get around, she and her pals ride a double-decker bus and a water taxi and even squeeze into an underground train! Of course, no sightseeing trip would be complete without taking lots of photos. This friendly introduction to a great city is perfect for little Maisy fans everywhere.

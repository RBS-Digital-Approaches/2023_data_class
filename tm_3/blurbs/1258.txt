“Power nap,” “the Oprah effect,” “girl power”-these are just some of the recent figures of speech to have entered our language. This dictionary has been completely revised for its second edition and includes 2,000 new idioms. It provides clear and concise definitions and explains how the idioms should be used. At the same time, the dictionary’s thematic arrangement makes it possible not only to study and compare all the idioms in a given subject area, but to match the right one to the right occasion.

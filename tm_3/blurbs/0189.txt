“THE MOST ADORABLE BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD” -Buzzfeed Once upon a time, Harlow’s best friend was her older sister, Sage, a thoughtful and loving miniature Dachshund. Harlow and Sage had a shared love for many things, including Christmas presents and the legendary Meryl Streep. They played together, cuddled together, and shared their deepest secrets, until September 2013, when, sadly, it was Sage’s time to retire to the doggie palace in the sky. Shortly after Sage’s passing, Harlow’s parents came home with Indiana, a Dachshund puppy with a killer sense of humor. It took a little getting used to, but after a few months of showing Indiana the ropes, Harlow began to recognize that a new adventure was about to unfold.Written in the wise and witty voice of Harlow the Weimaraner, Harlow and Sage (and Indiana) is richly illustrated with more than 125 stunning images of the highly photogenic pups who have taken social media by storm. This is a tale about the bond among three dogs, connected by deep love and unparalleled friendship. (It is also a little about Meryl.)

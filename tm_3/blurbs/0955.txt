The long-awaited follow-up to Pug Hill–from “a poignant and very funny” (Washington Post) writer.   Hope McNeill has worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for years, but this is the first time she’s been able to bring along her pug, Max (without sneaking him in in her tote bag). The occasion is a party for an Animals in 19th-Century Art exhibit, but the evening ends badly when a small but important painting seems to be missing. The Met needs Hope’s-and Max’s-help. And Hope has to keep it all a secret from her beloved, Manhattan DA Ben Brown.

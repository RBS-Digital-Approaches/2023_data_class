For over twenty-five years Noam Chomsky’s prolific political intervention has enlightened and inspired radicals while enraging their opponents in the halls of power. Beginning with a concise biography of his subject, Milan Rai presents a sympathetic yet probing analysis of Chomsky’s critique of United States’ media and foreign policy and his vision of a libertarian socialist future. Drawing on the entire range of Chomsky’s prodigious output, including little-known interviews and articles, Rai examines Chomsky’s assault on journalistic self-censorship and business control of the mass media. He shows how Chomsky challenges the US’s view of itself as a defender of democracy and equal rights by uncovering the hidden motivations of its foreign policy makers. Rai draws out features of Chomsky’s outlook which are sometimes obscured by a rapid coverage of a wide range of issues. In particular he emphasizes the importance of Chomsky’s cultural critique in his ordering of political priorities.Accessible and comprehensive, Chomsky’s Politics serves as an excellent introduction for those confronting Chomsky’s critique for the first time. For those already familiar with his work it corrects some widespread misunderstandings, provides new insights and chronicles the extraordinary contribution of a writer described by the New York Times as “one of the most important intellectuals alive.”

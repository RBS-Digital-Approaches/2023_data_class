Fans of John Feinstein will love Roy Morelli’s exciting year and don’t miss Thatcher Heldring’s newest novel, The Football Girl–about a girl who follows her passion for the game and tries out for the football team!Eighth-grader Roy Morelli can’t wait for baseball season to start so he can take his  rightful place as shortstop for the Pilchuk All-Star team. Being on the All-Stars  is just the warm-up for the big leagues: the varsity baseball team at the high school  Roy will go to next year. But when Roy’s divorced parents find out he’s failing history,  they make him quit the All-Stars. It’s not his fault the only thing interesting about  history class is Valerie Hopkins, and she won’t even give Roy the time of day. Now  Roy is stuck on a losing team in the wimpy rec league, and instead of playing ball  every spare minute, he’s spending his afternoons with a tutor—who just happens to  be his dad’s brainiac girlfriend. If Roy’s going to impress the varsity baseball  coach, he’s sure he should be looking out for number one, not wasting his time studying.  After all, baseball is what Roy does best. But when his grades continue to slide  and his teammates get tired of his know-it-all attitude, Roy Morelli will need to  step up to the plate. . . .“Heldring effectively captures the wise-guy, self-righteous attitude of  an eighth-grade boy and  carefully delineates Roy’s change of character  as he comes to  understand what it takes to be a team player. With plenty  of  well-described baseball action and a protagonist to care about, this  will be a hit with young baseball fans.“-Kirkus Reviews

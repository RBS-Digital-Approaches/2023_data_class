Haughty Bengals, faithful Maine coons, and feral strays: These are the haunting familiars that animate Nina De Gramont’s critically acclaimed debut collection of short fiction. Prowling through every story, these enigmatic creatures expose the hidden fears and passions of the female heart, and illuminate the profound truths of men and love. A young woman finds two dark surprises in her home: a magpie dismembered by her mischievous cat, and an unsettling glimpse of her fiancé’s secret inclinations…A pregnant housewife quietly suffers a visit from her troubled brother-in-law while her hidden anger comes to life in the suddenly hostile behavior of her docile house cat…A frustrated newlywed clings to the last vestige of her well-appointed upbringing–a pampered Himalayan high point–until a rangy stray cat shows her the true meaning of marriage…As clever, finessed, and keen as the feline disposition it celebrates, Of Cats and Men marks the arrival of an exciting new voice in fiction.From the Trade Paperback edition.

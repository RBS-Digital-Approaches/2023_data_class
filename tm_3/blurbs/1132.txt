In the beloved tradition of Christmas Advent calendars, this lift-the-flap board book lets children count down the days to the holiday by lifting twenty-five flaps. As they do, they see how a whole woodland menagerie of furry, fuzzy animals keep cozy in their own special corners of the natural world. This lovely, quiet book is perfect for families to use and read together as they await the arrival of Christmas. Beautifully detailed illustrations make this a book to look at again and again—even after Christmas has come and gone!It was originally published in 1994 as Lisa McCue’s The Animals’ Advent, in a slightly larger format. The new, smaller size is perfect for little hands. The book also makes an ideal pre-Christmas gift!

Focus your telescope and get ready to learn all about the night sky. Eyewitness Explorer: Night Sky Detective is full of activities for adventurous hands-on learning with activities to help spot different constellations, make paper planets, study Jupiter and its moons, create a star chart, escape velocity, and even launch a homemade rocket. Eyewitness Explorers encourage hands-on learning with 30 easy activities that help children observe, explore, and learn about the natural world. Each book explains the science behind the activities, laying the essential groundwork for contextualizing the experience to come. But at the heart of the books are the activities themselves — a chance to learn by doing with experiments that can be carried out right at home. Most can even be completed with materials already on hand, so there’s no complicated preparation or specialized equipment needed. Simply choose one of the projects and follow the step-by-step, photographically illustrated instructions to create rainbows, make a moth trap, grow stalactites, mix mineral paint, and much more.

They were hoofing it up when Jabba’s arch rival sent E522, a recycled assassin droid, to make them an offer they couldn’t refuse.Figrin Da’n didn’t do weddings. But Lady Valerian had imported herself a Whipid mate from her homeworld and was dead set on getting hitched in high style. And what with Figrin Da’n’s gambling debts, three thousand credits could set him up just fine. But before they could cut the cake, Lady Val’s bounty hunter bridegroom took Jabba’s bait, skipped town to find Han Solo, and the party exploded into murderous mayhem.This exclusive Star Wars "RM" audio dramatization features a wall-to-wall mix of densely interwoven environmental sounds, and authentic Star Wars "RM" special effects. Scored with John Williams’ original Star Wars "RM" music and Bith band compositions, We Don’t Do Weddings makes for truly out-of-this-world listening entertainment.From the Cassette edition.

Here’s the third book in the hilarious Moxy Maxwell series, which includes Moxy Maxwell Does Not Love Stuart  Little and Moxy Maxwell Does Not Love Writing Thank-you Notes.Moxy’s back, and ready (kind of, sort of) for her big piano recital! In this hilarious  third installment about everyone’s favorite ’tween procrastinator, Moxy Maxwell is  set to make her Piano Debut, playing a duet of “Heart and Soul” with her little sister,  Pansy. It’s too bad she has no time to practice. Between costume fittings, trying  on her crown, warming up her voice, and putting on her stage makeup, Moxy can’t possibly  worry about the actual performance. But soon it’s upon her, and Moxy feels something  she’s only felt once before in her entire life: nervous! She’s not sure she can go  on. Of course, Moxy is Moxy and she rises to the occasion brilliantly.From the Hardcover edition.

Ford’s mesmerizing first novel is the story of two godless pilgrims. Robard Hewes has driven across the country in the service of a destructive passion. Sam Newell is seeking the missing piece of himself. When these men converge, on an uncharted island in the Mississippi, each discovers the thing he’s looking for–amid a conflagration of violence that’s as shocking as it is inevitable."This is one of those books that hit you hard…a story filled with breathing characters and genius-crafted dialogue between moments of consummate description…. I can’t be unbiased. I’m mad for this book."–Elizabeth Ashton, Houston Chronicle

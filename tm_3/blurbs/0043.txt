From seeing-eye dogs to cats who sit in your lap, animals are there for us in more way than we can count. Helping us get through the day with a wag of the tail and a tilt of the head, they let us know that someone is on our side-no matter what. They also have an uncanny ability to break down barriers between people, bringing families and loved ones closer, and giving strangers an excuse to strike up conversation. In Tails of Love, each writer draws from her own unique perspective on our loyal friends–exploring the many mysterious ways they bring love into our lives.Featuring stories from New York Times bestselling authors Lori Foster and Stella Cameron, and Ann Christopher, Kate Angell, Marcia James, Dianne Castell, Donna MacMeans, Sarah McCarty, Patricia Sargeant, and Sue-Ellen Welfonder.A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM TAILS OF LOVE GOES TO THE ANIMAL ADOPTION FOUNDATION OF OHIO

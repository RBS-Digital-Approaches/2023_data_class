In this heart-stealing picture book, fine artist Robert Rahway Zakanitch gives us 16 masterful, soulful, impossibly expressive portraits of dogs, and Maya Gottfried wonderfully captures their voices and inner personalities in 16 enchanting poems. Itâ€™s a doggie delight! These dogs beg to be patted, tickled, scratched, and ruffled. Which one will be your best friend?

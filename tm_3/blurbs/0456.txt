First published in 1792, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was an instant success,   turning its thirty-three-year-old author into a minor celebrity. A pioneering work   of early feminism that extends to women the Enlightenment principle of “the rights   of man,” its argument remains as relevant today as it was for Woll-stonecraft’s contemporaries.    “Mary Wollstonecraft was not the first writer to call for women to receive a real,   challenging education,” writes Katha Pollitt in the new Introduction. “But she was   the first to connect the education of women to the transformation of women’s social   position, of relations between the sexes, and even of society itself. She was the   first to argue that women’s intellectual equality would and should have actual consequences.   The winds of change sweep through her pages.” This classic work of early feminism   remains as relevant and passionate today as it was for Wollstonecraft’s contemporaries.    This edition includes new explanatory notes.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Two timeless tales of summer love from #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts. Rebecca Malone—who has never traveled more than five hundred miles from Philadelphia—heads to Greece after quitting her job and selling off everything that she owns. Her friends and family think she’s crazy, but Rebecca has never felt saner—especially after meeting Stephen Nickodemus. And for the first time, following an “Impulse” just might give Rebecca’s heart the kick-start that it needs…Former model Zoe Fleming is now a single mother looking for some help with the bills. But J. Cooper McKinnon doesn’t seem like the perfect tenant. To Coop, a long-time bachelor and sportswriter, the harried Zoe doesn’t seem like the greatest landlord. But what starts out with mutual misgivings could turn into “The Best Mistake” both Zoe and Coop have ever made.

July 1 , 1973 OBITUARY Nancy Mitford , Author , Dead ; Satiric Novelist and Essayist By STEVEN R. WEISMAN Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES LONDON , July 1 -- Nancy Mitford , the prolific essayist , novelist and historian whose writing be enliven by satire and a firm British aristocratic perspective , die yesterday at her home in Versailles , France. She be 68 year old. Unabashedly snobbish and devastatingly witty , Miss Mitford achieve enormous success and popularity a one of Britain 's most piercing observer of social manners. Beginning with fiction that V. S. Pritchett once hail a help to begin `` an aristocratic revival in English literature , '' Miss Mitford move on to finely observed history , particularly of court life in France and Russia , and to widely enjoy essay and translations. But through all her writing , she never let her readers lapse into unawareness of her own aristocratic , shelter upbringing -- the object of much of Miss Mitford 's scalding satire but a background , nonetheless , which she take very seriously and continue to defend. In one of her most recent book , `` The Sun King , '' which be a portrait of Louis XIV 's life at Versailles , Miss Mitford unhesitatingly compare the plumbing at Versailles with what she have know on her own visit to Buckingham Palace in 1923. Indeed , one of Miss Mitford 's pet concern enter the history of obscure literary debate when , in 1955 , she publish perhaps her most famous essay on upper-class and non-upper- class form of speech. The essay spark such a controversy in Britain , with response from many major literary figure , that Miss Mitford be compel a year later to bring out a thin book , `` Noblesse Oblige , '' with her disquisition on the subject a it centerpiece. Her argument , a set-piece even today among literary parlor game , be that the more elegant euphemism use for any word be usually the non-upperclass thing to say -- or , in Miss Mitford 's word , simply non-U. Thus : It be very non-U to say `` denture '' ; `` false teeth '' will do. Ill be non-U ; sick be U. The non-U person resides at his home. The U person life in his house. And so forth. Perhaps Miss Mitford and only a few others would have have the credential to engage in this kind of argument. She be the old of six daughter of Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford , the second Baron Redesdale , who live with Lady Redesdale at Swinbrook , the family estate in Oxfordshire. The girl call their father `` Old Subhuman. '' `` My father and mother , illiterate themselves , be against education , and we girl have none though we be teach to ride and to speak French , '' Miss Mitford write in `` Twentieth Century Authors. '' `` I grow up as ignorant a an owl , come out in London and go to a great many balls. '' `` Here I meet various people who be not ignorant at all -- I make friend with the sort of people which include Messrs. Evelyn Waugh , John Betjeman , Sir Maurice Bowra and the brilliant Lord Berners. Very soon I become an intellectual snob. I try to educate myself , read enormously and write a few indifferent novels. '' Miss Mitford be not the only family member to win fame. In America , her most well- known sibling be her young sister , Jessica , the author , who write of the girl ' childhood in her own memoir , `` Daughters and Rebels. '' Miss Mitford 's first novel , `` Highland Fling , '' in 1931 , be -- like many that follow -- a `` comedy of manner '' base on her own experiences. It be follow by `` Christmas Pudding , '' `` Wigs on the Green '' and `` Pigeon Pie '' -- all exhibit what some critic felt be a style more akin to `` schoolgirl burble '' than acutely tune observation. Better receive be `` Pursuit of Love , '' 1945 ; `` Love in a Cold Climate , '' 1949 , and `` The Blessing , '' 1951. These be sometimes frankly sentimental but possess of a wit that Phyllis McGinley , the poet , find `` quite funny and rather frightening. '' Among the victim of her humor be Americans of any kind. Eventually Miss Mitford move to history -- '' by way of fiction , '' a Louis Auchincloss put it. In 1954 she write a biography of Madame de Pompadour and in 1966 her study of Louis XIV. Her most recent book , `` Frederick the Great , '' be publish three year ago. `` She seem to have bring a new talent to the study of history , '' Mr. Auchincloss write in 1969 , `` that of the sophisticated , worldly wise observer , who be able to penetrate old archive with a fresh eye for quality in the dead that she be specially qualify to recognize. '' `` In general , '' another observer write , `` the women. . .are judge more leniently than the men. '' Throughout her life , Miss Mitford do little travel beyond the boundary of her own country and France. Although one of her sister , Unity , who die in 1948 , become an enthusiastic admirer of Adolf Hitler , Nancy Mitford hat dictatorship and work for the Republicans in the Spanish civil war. After World War II , she decide to settle in France. Miss Mitford be marry to Peter Rodd in 1933 but the marriage end in divorce in 1958. Her only brother , Tom , be kill during the war. She be survive by four of her five sister , Pamela , Diana , Jessica and Deborah. She be a frequent visitor to London in recent year , visit with friend who be among Britain 's leading literary figures. `` Today , '' The Times of London say yesterday , `` they find their world colder and less merry : like Beatrice in 'Much Ado , ' she be bear under a star that dance .

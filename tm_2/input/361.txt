July 3 , 1997 OBITUARY James Stewart , the Hesitant Hero , Dies at 89 By THE NEW YORK TIMES James Stewart , whose movie portrayal of decent , idealistic and naive small-town Americans make him a beloved national icon , die yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills , Calif. He be 89. He die from a blood clot in his lung , The Associated Press reported. Mr. Stewart 's performance in some 80 movie earn him every major award bestow for his craft , and consistent acclaim and popularity for more than half a century. He be the last of that rare breed of male star whose career certify the star system a it operate virtually from the beginning of the sound era. Actors like Mr. Stewart , Spencer Tracy , Gary Cooper , Clark Gable , Cary Grant , John Wayne and Henry Fonda be large than life , and because the fusion of the performer ' public and private personality create something big than the sum of the two part , something mythical. The lanky actor with unruly hair and an ungainly stride have a boyish grin and an engaging manner. The Stewart way of speaking -- laconic , with a hesitant , nasal drawl -- be instantly recognizable by virtually every American. His early screen image , like his personal life , epitomize a Middle American ideal in a confusing , sophisticated world. `` America lose a national treasure today , '' President Clinton say yesterday. `` Jimmy Stewart be a great actor , a gentleman and a patriot. '' His archetypal role ( and his own favorite ) be that of George Bailey , the small-town banker in `` It 's a Wonderful Life , '' Frank Capra 's moralistic fantasy in which the hero be rescue from suicide by a pixieish angel who show him how much meaner life would have be in his hometown without him. The 1946 feature-length Christmas card be a failure among audience , who dismiss it a overly sentimental , but in later decade it become one of the most popular movie ever make and a holiday staple on television. After view `` It 's a Wonderful Life , '' President Harry S. Truman conclude , `` If Bess and I have a son , we 'd want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart. '' But , a Mr. Stewart mature , the diffident innocents he play in the late 1930 's and 40 's give way to more subtle and complicated role -- trouble , querulous protagonist tear between firmness and vulnerability , role in conflict with his accepted image. Mr. Stewart 's subtle and seemingly effortless work prompt the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times to hail him in 1990 a a great behavioral actor who absorb each role into his own physical frame , shape the mannerism , the voice and even the intelligence to coincide with those of his own persona. `` This he do with such simplicity and ease that , for many year , the initial response be to say that what he do be n't act , follow up by the damp , desperate criticism that he be always the same , '' Mr. Canby said. The role for which he be best remember include a naively heroic young senator in `` Mr. Smith Goes to Washington '' ( 1939 ) , a part that earn him major stardom ; a forthright reporter redeem a headstrong heiress ( Katharine Hepburn ) in `` The Philadelphia Story '' ( 1940 ) and a relentless defense attorney in `` Anatomy of a Murder '' ( 1959 ) . Also in the Stewart gallery of folk hero be a gun-shy marshal who tame a town -- and Marlene Dietrich -- in `` Destry Rides Again '' ( 1939 ) ; Monty Stratton , the Chicago White Sox pitcher who return to the mound after lose a leg , in `` The Stratton Story '' ( 1949 ) ; a beloved big-band leader in `` The Glenn Miller Story '' ( 1954 ) and Charles A. Lindbergh , a boyhood hero , in his solitary 1927 trans-Atlantic flight in `` The Spirit of St. Louis '' ( 1957 ) . Ungainly , Self-Effacing And Somehow Debonair Later in his career , a tougher , more worldly Stewart emerge in such Anthony Mann westerns a `` Winchester '73 , '' `` The Far Country , '' `` Bend of the River , '' `` The Naked Spur '' and `` The Man From Laramie. '' Alfred Hitchcock use him against type in such film a `` Rope '' and `` The Man Who Knew Too Much '' and especially a a voyeur photographer in `` Rear Window '' and a a retired detective entrance by two form of a mythic Kim Novak in `` Vertigo. '' When interview about his technique , the self-effacing actor reply characteristically , `` I do n't act , I react , '' and describe himself a an `` inarticulate man who try , '' without have `` all the answer , but for some reason , somehow , I make it. '' He offer his criterion for success : `` If you can do a part and not have the acting show. '' His modest appraisal be challenge by Donna Reed , his co-star in `` It 's a Wonderful Life. '' `` He 's so natural , so realistic , that I never know whether he be talk to me or do the scene '' she observed. `` He 's the most demanding actor I 've ever work with. '' Joan Crawford , another co-star , praise Mr. Stewart a an `` endearing perfectionist '' with `` a droll sense of humor and a shy way of watch you to see if you react to that humor. '' Weighing Mr. Stewart 's work opposite such matchless actress a Margaret Sullavan in Ernst Lubitsch 's `` Shop Around the Corner , '' Jean Arthur in Capra 's `` Mr. Smith , '' Ms. Hepburn in George Cukor 's `` Philadelphia Story , '' Marlene Dietrich in George Marshall 's `` Destry Rides Again '' and Grace Kelly in `` Rear Window , '' Mr. Canby say : he `` reveal a quality that at first seem out of sync with the shy , stammer personality favor by nightclub imitators. He be debonair. He have the same humor and lightness of touch that Fred Astaire express only through dance. Mr. Stewart be debonair when douse Miss Dietrich and Una Merkel with a bucketful of water ( 'Destry Rides Again ' ) or confine to a wheelchair with one leg in a plaster cast ( 'Rear Window ' ) . He be debonair even when wrestle with terrible guilt and a sense of loss in 'Vertigo. ' Also like Astaire when he dance , Mr. Stewart be best see on the screen in full figure , with all of the lean 6-foot-3 1/2-inch man capture in a single frame. He act with his whole body. The slight stoop and the way his wrinkled jacket hang from his shoulder be a integral to his performance in 'Harvey ' a any of playwright Mary Chase 's lines. '' As Best Friend To an Invisible Rabbit One of the actor 's most admired performance be that of the gently eccentric tippler Elwood P. Dowd in `` Harvey , '' whose companion be the title character , a giant , invisible rabbit.

After get his professional start on Broadway , he hone his craft in Hollywood 's big-studio era of the 1930 's and 40 's , whose leader he credit with great judgment , the courage to take chance and deep affection for movie-making.

'' `` I come out here a a contract player at MGM , and I go to work every day , '' he said. `` It might be a big part in a little picture , or a little part in a big picture.

November 1 , 1988 OBITUARY John Houseman , Actor and Producer , 86 , Dies By MARILYN BERGER John Houseman , who spend more than half a century in the theater a an influential producer and director but who do not achieve fame until , at the age of 71 , he portray a crusty law school professor in the film `` The Paper Chase '' and it subsequent television series , die of spinal cancer yesterday at his home in Malibu , Calif. He be 86 year old and despite his fail health have be work on various project until three day ago. Professor Kingsfield , the role he play in `` The Paper Chase , '' lead to another well-known part , that of a haughty spokesman for a brokerage house in it television commercial , deliver the line : `` They make money the old-fashioned way. They earn it. '' Mr. Houseman spend a lifetime in the theater both behind the footlights and in front of them. `` Almost every major theater in America be run by a Houseman protege , '' say the director James Bridges , who cast Mr. Houseman , his mentor , a Professor Kingsfield in the film `` The Paper Chase. '' Mr. Bridges say : `` Before there be Kingsfield there be John Houseman. He be the Kingsfield to many of the actor , producer , director on the American stage today. '' Eleven year after he come to the United States from Rumania by way of England , Mr. Houseman join with Orson Welles in 1937 to mount startling production of the classic in their avant-garde Mercury Theater. Their Mercury Theater of the Air produce `` The War of the Worlds '' broadcast that mark it 50th anniversary on Sunday , just hour before Mr. Houseman died. He have his first break in show business in 1934 when he be make the director of Virgil Thomson 's opera `` Four Saints in Three Acts , '' in a production that be underwrite by a Hartford organization call the Friends and Enemies of Modern Music. Toward what look like the end of a long career , when he be 66 year old , Mr. Houseman help establish the school of drama at the Juilliard School and also become the co-founder and longtime artistic director of the Acting Company , the tour repertory group whose alumnus include Kevin Kline and Patti LuPone. He resign a artistic director last summer. Mr. Houseman say he be about to retire into what he call `` a life of fairly restrict option '' when , through `` pure luck , '' Mr. Bridges , one of his former assistant at the Professional Theater Group at the University of California at Los Angeles , who be direct `` The Paper Chase , '' ask him to take the part of the formidable , slightly sadistic Professor Kingsfield. The role in the 1973 movie lead to an Academy Award in 1974 , to the re-creation of the role in a television series and ultimately to television commercial and a far more comfortable old age than he have anticipated. `` I become rich through this incredible accident of 'The Paper Chase , ' `` he said. He confess to enjoy his new celebrity a Professor Kingsfield , the imperious persona he carry over into his commercial for Smith Barney Harris & Upham , an investment concern. But the man on the screen be very different from the man himself. Mr. Houseman personally be warm , friendly and not at all the curmudgeonly character he have created. Became a Citizen in 1943 Mr. Houseman be bear on Sept. 22 , 1902 , in Bucharest , several year before his British mother and his Alsatian father , a successful grain trader , be married. Young Jacques Haussmann , a he be then call , become a seasoned traveler in the capital of Europe - he say he celebrate two of his first four birthday on board the Orient Express between Paris and Bucharest. His formal education begin and end at the Clifton school in England. He come to the United States in 1924 but his resident status be not regularize until he be admit a a legal immigrant in 1936. Even when he go to work for the Office of War Information , he be an alien - an enemy alien , since Rumania be part of the Axis. He become a citizen March 1 , 1943. A Director by 'Accident' As a young man , Mr. Houseman follow in the footstep of his father into the grain trade in the United States and abroad , but he lose his money and his business in the Depression. `` I be make a very bad living a an adapter , translator and hanger-around in the theater , '' he recall during an interview late in 1986. `` I become a director by pure accident. '' At a cocktail party he be introduce to the composer Virgil Thomson , who need someone to work on his opera and offer Mr. Houseman the job. `` There be no reason why he should have do that , '' Mr. Houseman said. `` I do n't know anything about anything. '' `` Four Saints in Three Acts '' have a libretto by Gertrude Stein ( `` Pigeons on the grass , ala '' ) and an all-black cast , whose member be choose because of their voice quality and because Mr. Thomson think they move with dignity. It open in Hartford in 1934 , be bring to New York and then tour the country. It be a critical success , but because the production mark him a a maverick and a highbrow , Mr. Houseman remember , it do not lead to many immediate offers. The Depression that ruin his grain business also offer him a lifeline -the Works Progress Administration 's Federal Theater Project. In 1935 Mr. Houseman and Orson Welles organize the W.P.A.'s Negro Theater Project , which make theater history with the production of a version of `` Macbeth '' set in Haiti , with voodoo priestess play the role of Shakespeare 's witches. Partnership With Welles This be the beginning of what be to become a fruitful but stormy partnership in which , Mr. Houseman say , Welles `` be the teacher , I , the apprentice. '' Mr. Houseman say he be both an eager student of Welles 's genius and a calming influence on Welles 's erratic , unpredictable nature. After 10 month with the Negro Theater Project , Mr. Houseman write in his memoir , he be face with the dilemma of risk his future `` on a partnership with a 20-year-old boy in whose talent I have unquestioning faith but with whom I must increasingly play the combined and tricky role of producer , censor , adviser , impresario , father , old brother and bosom friend. '' He take the chance and in 1936 , with Welles , create the Classical Theater , another W.P.A. project , for which Welles direct and play the title role in Marlowe 's `` Tragical History of Dr. Faustus. '' Mr. Houseman and Welles defy the Government and in effect ring down the curtain on Federal financing for their theater with their production of Marc Blitzstein 's proletarian musical `` The Cradle Will Rock. '' The production become a Broadway legend when the cast member , catch in a political imbroglio that close their theater , lead their audience in a ragtag parade uptown to a hastily rent space and , enjoin by Actors ' Equity from go on the stage , perform their role from their seats. While there be those who question whether Mr. Houseman 's role in the creative collaboration be as great a he later make it out to be , he do serve a Welles 's producer during some of Welles 's most productive years. `` You have to be pretty bloody good and pretty bloody clever to handle Orson , '' the actor Hume Cronyn said. The Mercury Theater be the direct offspring of the W.P.A. theater of which Mr. Houseman write , `` On the broad wing of the Federal eagle , we have rise to success and fame beyond ourselves a America 's young , clever , most creative and audacious producer to whom none of the ordinary rule of the theater applied. '' The creative magic be sustain and in 1937 the Mercury 's first commercial production , `` Julius Caesar , '' become another success. Mr. Houseman call the decision to use modern dress `` an essential element in Orson 's conception of 'Julius Caesar ' a a political melodrama with clear contemporary parallels. '' The Mercury become a milestone in the Broadway theater with it production , which also include `` The Shoemaker 's Holiday , '' `` Heartbreak House , '' `` Five Kings '' and a stage treatment of Richard Wright 's `` Native Son. '' 'Citizen Kane ' and Hollywood Success on the stage lead to the Mercury Theater of the Air , a series of hourlong radio program on CBS. Mr. Houseman write most of the script , which he say Welles perform with `` obsessive perfectionism. '' Their now legendary radio broadcast of `` The War of the Worlds , '' an adaptation of an H. G. Wells story about the invasion of Earth by creature from Mars , be so believable that it create panic along the East Coast. On Sunday even a new version of the program be broadcast to mark it 50th anniversary. The Welles-Houseman collaboration continue in Hollywood. Although Mr. Welles take credit for the screenplay of `` Citizen Kane , '' Mr. Houseman say the credit belong to Herman J. Mankiewicz , an assertion that lead to a break with Welles. Mr. Houseman take some credit himself for the general shaping of the story line and for edit the script.

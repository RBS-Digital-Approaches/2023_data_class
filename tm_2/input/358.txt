February 3 , 1996 OBITUARY Gene Kelly , Dancer of Vigor and Grace , Dies By ALBIN KREBS Gene Kelly , the dancer , actor , director and choreographer who bring a vigorous athleticism , casual grace and an earthy masculinity to the high romance of lavish Hollywood musical , die yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills , Calif. He be 83. His longtime publicity agent , Warren Cowan , say Mr. Kelly have never fully recover from stroke he suffer in 1994 and last year. Mr. Kelly 's highly developed sense of the possibility of dance on film invigorate classic musical like `` Anchors Aweigh , '' `` On the Town , '' `` An American in Paris '' and `` Singin ' in the Rain. '' A gift dancer with his own vibrant style , he also flourish a an innovative choreographer and director in the 1940 's and 50 's , the heyday of the big , splashy Hollywood musical. Mr. Kelly , who could also put over a song in a high , thin voice , bring to his film an inventive technique that enable him to create unusual and imaginative dance routine that usually arise directly out of a plot or script situation. Thus million of moviegoer remember Mr. Kelly dance merrily in a downpour in `` Singin ' in the Rain , '' hoof with an animated mouse , Jerry , in `` Anchors Aweigh , '' hop over garbage can in a sequence in `` It 's Always Fair Weather '' and , with the aid of special process photography , dance with himself in the `` alter ego '' number from `` Cover Girl. '' In addition to his movie , which include `` The Pirate , '' `` Brigadoon '' and the drama `` Inherit the Wind , '' Mr. Kelly be also a star on Broadway , where he create the title role of the heel a hero in `` Pal Joey , '' choreograph `` Best Foot Forward '' and direct Rodgers and Hammerstein 's `` Flower Drum Song. '' `` I do n't really know why I click , '' Mr. Kelly say many year later. `` I do n't want to be a dancer. I just do it to work my way through college. But I be always an athlete and gymnast , so it come naturally. `` In the 1930 's , when I start , Martha Graham be the only dancer do anything modern , but she do it all to classical music. I could n't see myself do 'Swan Lake ' every night , and I want to develop a truly American style. The only dancer in the movie at that time with any success be Fred Astaire , but he do very small , elegant step in a top hat , white tie and tails. I be too big physically for that kind of dancing , and I look well in a sweatshirt and loafer anyway. It be n't elegant , but it be me. '' Eugene Curran Kelly be bear on Aug. 23 , 1912 , in Pittsburgh. His mother insist that all five of the Kelly child take music and dance lesson , and in high school Mr. Kelly continue dance lesson while also play on the football and hockey teams. His education at Pennsylvania State College be interrupt by the Depression , and his first job be teach gymnastics at a summer camp for boys. He be later able to major in economics at the University of Pittsburgh and receive a degree in 1933 , but job be scarce and he go to work for a dancing school partly own by his mother. Two year later , the school be rename the Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance and soon a successful branch be open in Johnstown. Meanwhile , Mr. Kelly direct play produce locally and form a dance act with his brother Fred , with whom he perform in a theater for child at the Chicago World 's Fair in 1934. In the mid-1930 's Mr. Kelly also redirect vaudeville act that pass through Pittsburgh. Mr. Kelly do not decide to try his luck in New York until 1938 , when he be 27 year old. His first job be a a Broadway chorus boy in 1938 's `` Leave It to Me , '' dance while Mary Martin sing `` My Heart Belongs to Daddy , '' but the next year he win critical acclaim for his featured role a the comic hoofer in William Saroyan 's play `` The Time of Your Life. '' That success lead to his be cast in `` Pal Joey , '' the 1940 Rodgers and Hart musical , in which he play the unscrupulous central character so convincingly that John Martin , a critic for The New York Times , say , `` He be not only glib-footed , but he have a feeling for comment and content that give his dance personal distinction and raise it several notch a a dancing art. '' Mr. Kelly 's ability to meld singing and dance with characterization and the demand of the play 's plot attract so much notice that David O. Selznick sign him to an exclusive Hollywood contract. At the time , Mr. Kelly be appear in `` Pal Joey '' at night and by day choreograph the Broadway musical hit `` Best Foot Forward. '' In 1941 , he leave for Hollywood , where he be to bring a new vitality to dance on film and help change the whole concept of movie musicals. Mr. Selznick have no musical plan , however , and lend Mr. Kelly to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , the studio most noted for lavish musicals. His first film , in 1942 , be `` For Me and My Gal , '' in which he star a a small-time vaudeville hoofer opposite Judy Garland. It be a huge success , but MGM , after buy the new star 's contract from Mr. Selznick , relegate him to relatively minor part in `` DuBarry Was a Lady , '' `` Thousands Cheer , '' and the wartime drama `` Cross of Lorraine. '' In `` Cover Girl , '' co-starring with Rita Hayworth in 1944 on loan to Columbia Pictures , Mr. Kelly 's career take off. With the aid of Stanley Donen , with whom he be to direct and choreograph several movie in year to follow , Mr. Kelly develop the celebrate `` alter ego '' solo dance with his ectoplasmic self , the character 's conscience. Photographed separately , then combine on a single strip of film , the two Kelly image seem to pursue each other up and down flight of step , to threaten each other and leap over each other 's heads. `` For once , a dance on the screen be not merely a specialty but actually develop character and advance plot , '' write a New York Times critic. The alter ego sequence and others in `` Cover Girl '' significantly advance the use of movie song-and-dance number that evolve naturally from the plot and the action on screen. Mr. Kelly say later : `` In my first picture , I make a startling discovery. Things dance on the screen do not look the way they do on the stage. On the stage , dance be three-dimensional , but a motion picture be two-dimensional. Also , I felt the dancer in film have never have the opportunity to probe emotional and act problem adequately. So I try to do thing uniquely cinematic , that you could n't do on a stage. Call it 'cine-dancing , ' or whatever , but I try to invent the dance to fit the camera and it movements. '' Mr. Kelly 's choreographic inventiveness be credit with the success of the trail-blazing live-dance-with-animation sequence in `` Anchors Aweigh '' in 1945. He have a hard time persuade MGM official that they should spend $ 100,000 and two month shoot an eight-minute number , in which he would dance with Jerry the mouse from the `` Tom and Jerry '' cartoon series. Simple live action and animation go back to silent-film day , but Mr. Kelly 's idea involve color and intricate dance step for himself and the cartoon character , and require complex laboratory and processing work. For the charming sequence , Mr. Kelly first dance against a plain blue background , then animator film the mouse song-and-dance portion. What audiences saw be a composite picture make from the two separate film , with man and mouse happily dance and singing. The procedure be common now , even in television commercial , but in the mid-1940 's it be hail a a cinematic breakthrough. Before join the Navy in 1944 , Mr. Kelly appear with his friend Fred Astaire for the first time in a single number , Gershwin 's `` Babbitt and the Bromide '' in MGM 's opulent , star-studded `` Ziegfeld Follies. '' `` It be n't a battle of dancer , but our different style be purposely make apparent , '' Mr. Kelly said. `` My style be strong , wide open ; Fred 's be intimate , cool , easy. He can give an audience pleasure just by walk across a dance floor. '' After the war , Mr. Kelly 's first big picture be `` The Pirate , '' a 1948 spoof of swashbuckling adventure in which he again star with Judy Garland , with whom he sing the rousing `` Be a Clown. '' James Agee , the critic , find Mr. Kelly 's performance `` very ambitious , painfully misguide , by John Barrymore out of the elder Douglas Fairbanks. '' In `` The Three Musketeers '' ( 1948 ) , Mr. Kelly do not dance , but a D'Artagnan he use his balletic skill to burlesque some fencing scenes. One of Mr. Kelly 's most memorable dance performance come in the seven-minute `` Slaughter on 10th Avenue '' ballet sequence in `` Words and Music , '' a 1948 movie that be only subliminally base on the life of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Most critic agree that about the only thing to cheer about the film be the Rodgers ballet , in which Mr. Kelly be partner with Vera-Ellen. In 1949 , Mr. Kelly make two film with Frank Sinatra , `` Take Me Out to the Ball Game '' and one of his all-time hit , `` On the Town , '' which he direct and choreograph with Mr. Donen and film mostly on location in New York City. Mr. Kelly , whose co-star include Betty Garrett , Ann Miller and Vera-Ellen , turn the film into an exhilarating , joyful experience that begin with the brassy `` New York , New York ( It 's a Helluva Town ) '' open number and never let up in it mood of pervasive effervescence. `` This film be a milestone , '' he say in 1977. `` It be the first musical to be shoot on location. We take the musical off the sound stage and show that it could be realistic. The idea of do such a thing be anathema to the studio moguls. We shoot a lot of it in New York and show sailor get off their ship in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and singing and dance through the street of New York. You ca n't imagine how crazy everybody think this be at the time , but it change the face of musicals. The picture have date a bit , but it 's the closest to my heart. '' But some of Mr. Kelly 's most popular and artistically successful film be yet to come. In 1951 , `` An American in Paris , '' in which he receive sole star billing , win eight Academy Awards , include best picture of the year , and a special Oscar for Mr. Kelly for his contribution to screen choreography. An integral part of the film be a 17-minute ballet conceive by Mr. Kelly and the director , Vincente Minnelli , a a mean of show the impact Paris have on the hero. Costumes , set and dance movement for the ballet be borrow from the style of such artist a Dufy , Renoir , Utrillo , Rousseau , van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec and the music dance to by Mr. Kelly and Leslie Caron be George Gershwin 's `` American in Paris '' suite. `` Singin ' in the Rain , '' release in 1952 , be one of the last of the big MGM musical and it be , say Vincent Canby , film critic of The New York Times , in a 1975 appraisal , `` a movie masterpiece. '' Again team with Mr. Donen , Mr. Kelly help to direct and choreograph the affectionate spoof of the start of the talkie era in movies. The movie make splendid use of such Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown song a `` You Were Meant for Me , '' `` You Are My Lucky Star '' and `` All I Do Is Dream of You. '' In the title number , a love-struck Mr. Kelly , with an umbrella a his principal prop , sang and splash ecstatically and obliviously through a downpour on an all-but-deserted street. The sequence be widely regard a a classic piece of cinematic choreography. Since it be a period piece in the first place , take place in the Hollywood of the 1920 's , when sound be revolutionize the movie business , `` Singin ' in the Rain '' even today do not seem date , possibly because , a Mr. Kelly put it , `` when you work in a period that be , you have some distance and a good chance to make a picture last. '' Debbie Reynolds , who be 18 at the time and have her first major role in `` Singin ' in the Rain , '' have never sing or dance before , but she say year later : `` I learn a lot from Gene. He be a perfectionist and a disciplinarian : the most exacting director I 've work for. And he have a good temper. Every so often he would yell at me and make me cry. But it take a lot of patience for him to work with someone who have never dance before. '' In 1989 , `` Singin ' in the Rain '' be among the first 25 film choose by the Library of Congress for it National Film Registry of significant motion pictures. Mr. Kelly 's last major musical at MGM be `` Brigadoon '' ( 1954 ) , a disappointment , and `` It 's Always Fair Weather ( 1955 ) and `` Les Girls '' ( 1957 ) , which be both hits. In the 1950 's , he also appear in `` Deep in My Heart , '' `` Marjorie Morningstar '' and `` The Devil Makes Three , '' and he produce and direct `` The Happy Road , '' `` Tunnel of Love '' and other movies. Generally regard a an artistic as well a a commercial failure be Mr. Kelly 's ambitious project `` Invitation to the Dance , '' a three-part , plotless dance film without dialogue release in 1956. Mr. Kelly star in the film and direct and choreograph it. `` The public be n't ready for a serious dance film , and besides , by the time it come out , the popularity of film musical have decline , '' Mr. Kelly said. He nevertheless say he believe the public could be teach to appreciate dance , and late in 1958 conceive , write , narrate and dance in an NBC-TV special call `` Dancing Is a Man 's Game , '' in which he use athlete to demonstrate the sheer physicality and manliness of dance , often view by Americans a an effete art. That same year , Mr. Kelly return to Broadway to direct the hit Rodgers and Hammerstein musical `` Flower Drum Song , '' In 1960 , Mr. Kelly be invite to write and choreograph for the Paris Opera ballet troupe a zesty modern jazz ballet , which he set to Gershwin 's `` Concerto in F. '' He give the ballet the punning title `` Pas de Dieux , '' and he receive 23 curtain call after it premiere. A pa de deux he create for the San Francisco Ballet in 1982 be not a enthusiastically greeted. Over the year there be many appearance on television special by Mr. Kelly , and he also have a weekly series on ABC-TV in 1963 call `` Going My Way , '' in which he be see a a priest. Mr. Kelly also continue to direct an occasional movie , include `` Hello , Dolly ! '' in 1969 and `` The Cheyenne Social Club '' in 1970. His last performance on screen be dance on roller skate in the 1980 movie `` Xanadu , '' with Olivia Newton-John , a reprise of a number he do with his brother , Fred , year earlier. He also reminisce in the 1994 anthology film `` That 's Entertainment ! III.

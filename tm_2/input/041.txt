August 12 , 1919 OBITUARY Carnegie Started a a Bobbin Boy By THE NEW YORK TIMES Until he be a septuagenarian , Andrew Carnegie believe that he be bear in 1837. Then on a return visit to his native town in Scotland he learn that the date 1837 in the church record merely mean that the record be commence in that year , and he be list a a living child in the first census. He announce his correction of the date of his birth by click the news to his brother telegrapher on a miniature telegraph instrument at his plate at the dinner they be give in his honor , suppose it to be his seventy-first when it be really his seventy-third birthday. He be bear Nov. 23 , 1835 , in Dunfermline , a little manufacturing town in Fifeshire , Scotland , at that time note for it weaving. His father and his ancestor for a long way back have be weaver , and at the time of Andrew 's birth the elder Carnegie own three or four hand loom , one of which he operate himself , and hire extra hand for the others a the trade required. Andrew be to have be a weaver , too , but new invention be soon to abolish the industry , and William Carnegie , his father , be the last of the weaving line. `` I owe a great deal to my mother , '' he write in 1914. `` She be companion , nurse , seamstress , cook , and washerwoman , and never until late in life have a servant in the house. Yet she be a cultivated lady who teach me most of what I know. '' He earn his first penny by recite Burns 's long poem , `` Man Was Made to Mourn , '' without a break. There be a story that in Sunday school , be call upon to recite some Scripture text , he astonish the assembly by give this : `` Look after the penny , and the pound will take care of themselves. '' Wealth Put at $ 500,000,000 Estimates of Mr. Carnegie 's wealth make yesterday put it at possibly $ 500,000,000. When he retire in 1901 he sell his security of the Carnegie Steel Company to the United States Steel Corporation for $ 303,450,000 in bond of that company. He be possess of large interest in addition to those bonds. When he start in 1901 to endow his great benefaction he make inroad into his capital for several year in gift to library for peace propaganda , and to other philanthropic causes. The fortune of $ 303,450,000 in 5 per cent. bond , if allow to increase by the accumulation of interest and reinvestment since 1901 would amount to about a billion dollar today , but his numerous benefaction prevent this. According to financial authority , however , the ironmaster 's ambition to die poor be not realize , and , despite the scale of his philanthropy , it be believe that his fortune be at his death as large a it ever was. Elihu Root , Jr. , son of former United States Senator Root , whose father for year have be Mr. Carnegie 's counsel , decline yesterday to discuss Mr. Carnegie 's affair , other than to say that he be a citizen of New York City and to admit that his will doubtless would be probate here. When he be 12 year old the steam loom drive his father , the master weaver , out of business , and , reduce to poverty , the family emigrate to America. There be four , the parent and two boy , Andrew and Thomas. They settle at Allegheny City , Penn. , across the river from Pittsburgh , in 1848. The father and Andrew find work in a cotton factory , the son a bobbin boy. His pay be $ 1.20 in this , his first job. He be soon promote , at a slight advance , to be engineer 's assistant , and he stoke the boiler and run the engine in the factory cellar for twelve hour a day. It be at this time , he afterward say , that the inspiration come for his subsequent library benefactions. Colonel Anderson , a gentleman with a library of about 400 book , open it to the boy ever week-end and let them borrow any book they wanted. Carnegie make full use of the opportunity. `` Only he who have long a I do for Saturdays to come , '' he say , `` can understand what Colonel Anderson do for me and the boy of Allegheny. Is it any wonder that I resolve if ever surplus wealth come to me , I would use it imitate my benefactor ? '' Becomes a Telegraph Messenger At 14 , he become a telegraph messenger. The Superintendent of the office , James Reid , also a Scot , take a liking to the new boy. Indeed , it be his Scotch accent that warm Reid 's heart toward him , and get him the job. Andrew have not be there a month before he ask Mr. Reid to teach him telegraphy , and spend all his spare time in practice. It be the first step upward. `` My entrance into the telegraph office , '' say Carnegie , `` be a transition from darkness to light -- from fire a small engine in a dark and dirty cellar into a clean office with bright window and a literary atmosphere , with book , newspaper , pen , and pencil all around me. I be the happy boy alive. '' One day a death message come before the operator arrived. Carnegie take it , and deliver it , and this lead to his promotion to be an operator. When the Pennsylvania Railroad put up a telegraph wire of it own he become clerk under Divisional Superintendent Thomas A. Scott , at a salary increase to $ 35 a month. Mr. Scott get $ 125 a month , `` and , '' Carnegie say , `` I use to wonder what on earth he could do with so much money. '' At that time telegraphy be still new. The dot and dash be not read by sound , but be all impress on tape , and Carnegie be say to have be the third operator in the United States to read message by sound alone. He be now Colonel Scott 's private secretary. One morning when Colonel Scott be late come down the train be get tangle up in the yards. The young private secretary write out such order a he know his chief would give and put them on the wires. When Colonel Scott arrive , greatly disturb over what he suppose , and prepare to plunge into the work of straighten thing out , Carnegie tell what he have do and say the train be all under way. Scott say nothing to him , but to the President of the road he report that he `` have a little Scotch devil in his office who would run the whole road if they 'd only give him a chance. '' His First Investment His father die when Andrew be 16 , and a the breadwinner of the family he advise his mother to make her investment , $ 600 , in ten share of Adams Express stock. She mortgage her home to do it , and there be a monthly dividend of 1 per cent. `` I can see that first check of $ 10 dividend money , '' he say after his retirement. `` It be something new to all of u , for none of u have ever receive anything but from toil. '' This first investment be make on the advice of Scott , who have tell him that it would be a good one and have offer to help him if he could not raise enough. Colonel Scott become General Superintendent of the Pennsylvania in 1858 and Vice President in 1860 , take Carnegie along with him at each rise. In May , 1861 , the civil war have break out and Scott be appoint Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military railroad and telegraph , and again he take Carnegie with him. Carnegie be now Superintendent of the Western division of the road , and do not want to go to Washington , but Scott insisted. Mr. Carnegie be place in charge of the Government telegraph communications. He go to Annapolis and open communication which the Confederates have interrupted. He start out on the first locomotive which run from Annapolis to Washington. While pass Elbridge Junction he notice that the wire have be peg down by the enemy. He stop the engine , jump down beside the wire , and cut them. One of them spring up and give him a wound in the cheek , the scar of which remain with him all through life. He be on the field at Bull Run in charge of the communication , and be the last man on the last train that leave for Washington when the rout began. Meets Sleeping Car Inventor While travel on his division of the road one day he meet a man who say his name be T. T. Woodruff , and that he have invent a sleep car. Mr. Carnegie be interested , and after see a model he become convinced of it advantages. He arrange an interview between Woodruff and Scott , and they form a small company which result in the use on the Pennsylvania of the first sleeping car ever use in the world. They give Carnegie an interest , but when his assessment , $ 217.50 , come due , he have not the money ; he borrow it , however , from a banker in Altoona and repay the loan at the rate of $ 15 a month. His other assessment be pay from his share of the earnings of the car , and he make a profit on this venture of about $ 200,000. Mr. Carnegie 's first attempt to invest the fortune he be begin to make come when he put $ 40,000 in a company form for the development of an untried piece of oil land. But oil be not find , he grow discourage , and he finally succeed in sell out one- third of his holding for $ 3,000. Then he go to Europe , and while he be away the company strike oil , and the share remain to him be worth a quarter of a million. Two of his fellow workman , name Piper and Schiffler , have attract his attention by their work on bridges. He propose to them to organize a company for building bridge , and the Keystone Bridge Company be form about 1863. His brother Thomas have become interested in iron work , and Andrew , after consult with him , organize the Cyclops mill for the production of structural iron to be use in railway bridges. Colonel Scott join with them , but the project be not successful , and Andrew Carnegie have to turn to Thomas to help him get out of it. He propose that his brother and Henry Phipps , Thomas 's partner , should form a combination that would relieve him of his rolling mill , and a union of interest be bring about in 1865. The result be the Union Iron Mills. It be just at the right time. The civil war have just end and the great expansion be beginning. The new concern make great profit , and Carnegie propose far ventures. It be the era of the building of railroad and the development of the West. Steel rail have become worth $ 80 to $ 100 a ton. Adopts Bessemer Steel Process By this time Andrew Carnegie be recognize a the leader of this Napoleonic combination , which , with every new success , reach out further. On a visit to England in 1868 he discover the success be obtain there with the Bessemer process , and bring the idea home with him and adopt it in his mills. After he introduce the Bessemer steel process in this country he become principal owner of the Homestead and Edgar Thomson Steel Works and other large plant a head of the firm of Carnegie , Phipps & Co. and Carnegie Brothers & Co. In 1899 the interest be consolidate in the Carnegie Steel Company , which in 1901 be merge in the United States Steel Corporation , when Mr. Carnegie retire from business. The only great clash with labor which occur while Mr. Carnegie be in business be the Homestead strike of 1892. He be in Europe at the time , and come in for much criticism for not return and for let the trouble go to a finish without any action by him. He , however , make an explanation long afterward. `` I be coach through the Scottish Highlands on my holiday , '' Mr. Carnegie tell the Industrial Relations Commission in 1915 , `` and do not hear of the lamentable riot at Homestead until day after it occurred. I wire at once that I would take the first steamer home , but be request not to come. '' He say that after his return he tell the Homestead roller that his partner have offer liberal term and he could not have offer more , and that one of the men say : `` Oh , Mr. Carnegie , it be n't a question of dollar ! The boy would have let you kick them , and they would n't let another man stroke their hair. '' And he also tell the commission a story of his treatment of Burgess McLuckie , one of the Homestead men who disappear to avoid arrest after the riots. Professor van Dyke of Rutgers College tell him that he have meet McLuckie work a a laborer in a mine at Sonora , Mexico. Carnegie ask the professor to offer McLuckie any help he might need , and on his return to the West he do so. He find that McLuckie have obtain a position with the Sonora Railway , drive well , and be prospering. `` You do n't know , '' say the professor , `` whose money I be tell to help you with. '' He do not. `` Well , it be Mr. Carnegie's. '' `` Then , '' relate Mr. Carnegie , `` come the slow , earnest response : 'That be damn white of Andy. ' When I hear this I suggest to my friend Van Dyke that it would n't be a bad epitaph to grace one 's tombstone. If it ever do I hop there would be no long blank between the d's. Each letter should be put down to give McLuckie 's proper expression. '' He sell out to the Steel Corporation for $ 420,000,000 , and in his testimony before the Stanley Committee in 1912 , refer to this bargain , he exclaim , `` What a fool I be ! I have since learn from the inside that we could have receive $ 100,000,000 more from Mr. Morgan if we have place that value on our property. '' His Peace Propaganda Of all his field of public activity he take most interest , probably , in his peace propaganda. An offshoot of his peace labor be his interest in bring about arbitration in Central and South America. He aid in the organization of various league and commission to this end , and when Secretary of State Elihu Root return from his tour of South America Mr. Carnegie at once give Mr. Root 's alma mater , Hamilton College , $ 200,000 `` in memory of the service of Senator Root in behalf of international peace. '' In 1907 he send a peace commission to the Latin-American republics. `` Not so long ago , '' say Mr. Carnegie in 1907 , `` a speaker recite in my hearing how he have see the most powerful naval vessel in the world -- the Dreadnought with her 18,000 ton displacement. When my turn come I say that I must regret to dispute the statement. I myself have see the most powerful naval vessel in the world. She be a tiny yacht-like vessel , paint in beautiful white , with a flag at her masthead and a toy cannon on her deck -- for use in fire salute , mostly. `` Such dainty vessel a these serve to maintain the neutrality of the North American great lakes. The little white yacht be the true dreadnought. The name of the other , the vast , gloomy and terrible engine , should be 'Dread-everything ' -- dread wound , dread shot , dread drowning , dread savage , hellish passion ; dread miserable , torture , fruitless death. '' If there seem an inconsistency in his attack on armament and the making of it , in that he himself have once engage in the manufacture of armor plate , he have an answer ready. He have engage in it reluctantly. He have decline to bid to President Cleveland for armor manufacture , despite Secretary Whitney 's pleading to him to reconsider. President Harrison and Secretary Tracy have urge him , but he have refused. Then , while he be coach in Scotland , he receive a telegram from Tracy say : `` The President considers it your duty to contract for the armor for your country ; the ship now wait for it. '' Carnegie , accord to his story , reply : `` That settle it. That command from the President of my country be a command from on high. '' His Famous Utterance His famous utterance about `` die disgraced '' appear in an article in the North American Review in 1898 , in which he say : `` The day be not far distant when the man who die leave behind him million of available wealth , which be free for him to administer during life , will pass away 'unwept , unhonored , and unsung , ' no matter to what use he leave the dross which he can not take with him. Of such a these the public verdict will be , 'The man who die thus rich die disgraced. ' '' When he come back to the United States in 1907 he be the central figure of the dedication of the Carnegie Institute at Pittsburgh , which have cost him $ 6,000,000. In a remarkable speech he say that he could not bring himself to a realization of what have be done. He felt like Aladdin , when he saw this building and be aware that he have put it up , but he could not bring himself to a consciousness of have do it any more than if he have produce the same effect by rub a lamp. He could not feel the ownership of what he have give , and he could not feel that he have give it away. In `` Problems of today , '' a book publish in 1907 , Mr. Carnegie express some view on wealth which be unusual in a millionaire. He declare socialism , view upon it financial side , to be just , and say , `` A heavy progressive tax upon wealth at death of owner be not only desirable , it be strictly just. '' And he favor an income tax. Before the passage of the Underwood law he say in a speech at Montrose , Scotland : `` Great Britain be ahead of the United States in have a progressive income tax. But do not flatter yourselves , we shall catch up with you very soon. '' A little later he express himself a please with the Underwood bill , so far a the income tax feature be concerned. Mr. Carnegie do not believe in alms-giving. His idea be to help others help themselves , which be why he say , of his gift of organ to church , `` I now only give one-half the cost , the congregation first provide the other. '' As for beggar , he be proud of his indifference to them : `` I never give a cent to a beggar , nor do I help people of whose record I be ignorant ; this at least be one of my really good actions. '' Another side. Hearing two or three year ago that a librarian in his library at Atlanta be go to marry he write her a long letter of congratulation in Scotch dialect , and then mention a little inclosure of $ 100,000 in steel bond a a wedding present. In speak to her friend about it Miss Annie Wallace , the bride , say the letter please her about as much a do the gift inclosed. He conceive the original idea of form a corporation for the purpose of pay out money. It be the Home Trust Company , and it be simply his disburse office. Its headquarters be in New York. One of Mr. Carnegie 's attempted benefaction be receive with such general hostility that he drop it. He propose to solve the age-old question , `` What shall we do with our ex-Presidents ? '' by give them a pension of $ 25,000 a year , and do the same for their widow so long a they remain unmarried. There be a chorus of disapproval at this suggestion , and he give it up. It be also report that Carnegie , who be an anti- imperialist , have offer $ 25,000,000 to the United States Government to turn over the Philippines to their inhabitants. This untenable plan be not well receive either. Honors Conferred on Him He be make Lord Rector of the University of St. Andrew , Edinburgh , in 1903 , and receive it LL. D. in 1905. In 1907 France make him a Commander of the Legion of Honor. In 1907 Queen Wilhelmina of Holland confer on him the Order of Orange- Nassau , an order reserve for those who have benefit the country or the royal family. the Duke of Sutherland celebrate the fact that he have take up a residence in Scotland by name him , in 1899 , a Justice of the Peace for Sutherlandshire. But the appointment be illegal , a Carnegie be not a British subject , and be annulled. For twenty-seven year Mr. Carnegie have be President of the New York Oratorio Society. He be President of the New York Peace Society , Vice President of the Nineteenth Century Club , an honorary alumnus of Princeton University , and a member of the Lotos , the Union League , and many other clubs. He be the author of `` An American Four-in-Hand in Britain , '' 1883 ; `` Round the World , '' 1884 ; `` Triumphant Democracy , '' 1886 ; `` The Gospel of Wealth , '' 1900 ; `` The Empire of Business , '' 1902 ( since translate into eight different language ; ) `` The Life of James Watt , '' 1906 , and `` Problems of Today , '' 1909. In 1888 he marry Louise Whitefield , who be twenty year his junior. They have one child , Margaret , bear in 1897. Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie spend their honeymoon in the Isle of Wight , and then they go to Scotland , where they lease a castle and occupy it for ten years. In 1897 , the year of Margaret 's birth , Mr. Carnegie buy Skibo , and since then it have be their regular Summer home from May to October. Mrs. Carnegie 's chief philanthropic interest have be to work among the thousand-odd tenant of the estate. Mr. Carnegie 's only daughter , Margaret , be marry on April 23 to Ensign Roswell Miller , U. S. N. The bridegroom , son of a former President of the Chicago , Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad , who die in 1913 , have not complete his college course when war be declared. In 1916 he leave Stevens Institute in Hoboken , where he be take a course in civil engineering , to drive an ambulance in France , and when the United States become involve enter the navy a an Ensign. It be say at the time of the wedding that after the honeymoon Mr. Miller and his bride would go to Princeton , N. J. , where he would complete his study before enter upon a professional career. The former Miss Carnegie , heiress of her father 's million , be 22 year old. Her husband be two year her senior. League Plan Made Him Happy Ironmaster , in Recent Letter , Said He Believed It Meant End of Wars What be believe to have be one of the last letter write by Mr. Carnegie , in which he express his gratification at the propose League of Nations , be make public here yesterday by Charles C. James , a broker , to whom the communication be addressed. The letter , which be write in response to one sent to Mr. Carnegie by Mr. James call attention to a statement of the ironmaster , make in 1914 , that no hereditary monarch , Czar , Emperor , or King , should have the right to declare war , be date Aug. 9. `` I rejoice in have live to see the day , '' say Mr. Carnegie 's letter , `` when , a Burns put it , 'man to man the world o'er shall brother be and a ' that. ' I believe this happy condition be assure by the League of Nations and that civilization will now march steadily onward , with no more great war to mar it progress.

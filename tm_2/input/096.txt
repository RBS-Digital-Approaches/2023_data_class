Mr. Kern be also to have do a score for the Hammerstein and Richard Rodgers production of `` Annie Oakley , '' schedule for April , but have not begin this assignment. He have stay at the Hotel St. Regis. Known Best for `` Show Boat '' One of America 's foremost composer of music for the theatre and screen , Mr. Kern be rat by critic with Victor Herbert in the field of musical theatre , and his `` Show Boat '' have be one of the high-water mark of the media. Tunes which have become part of the native songbook -- like `` Ol ' Man River , '' `` Why Do I Love You ? '' , `` They Did n't Believe Me '' and `` Smoke Gets in Your Eyes '' -- pour from his keyboard with a regularity that be the envy and amazement of his contemporaries. During a period of forty year he be credit with a total of 104 stage and screen vehicle contain his melodies. Fifteen of these be report to have pass the 2,000,000 mark in record sales. It be say of him that he be not a graduate of Tin Pan Alley. Strictly speaking , only once , with Oscar Hammerstein 2d , who write the lyric for `` Show Boat , '' do he deliberately write a song hit outside of a show or screen play. That be `` The Last Time I Saw Paris. '' He call himself a `` musical clothier -- nothing more or less , '' and say : `` I write music to both the situation and the lyric in plays. '' But critic point out that he be a finished musician and be able to create elaborate effect of counterpoint and complex instrumental and vocal ensemble which give his operettas real value. A Modest Man A man of much modesty , he claim no special rank a an artist. He once tell an admirer : `` The fact that the theatregoing public like my music be no credit to me. There be many other composer who write good music that the public do n't like. '' Olin Downes , music critic for The New York Times , once write : `` A student of composition in America and Europe , Mr. Kern have technical and artistic background in a degree not share by most of his American colleague in his field. He know his Richard Strauss , Rimsky-Korsakoff , Wagner , Berlioz et al. '' Of his `` Show Boat , '' the critic say : `` This be a score which , by reason of it melodic inspiration , it workmanship , it reflection of period and environment , have already win the position of a classic of it kind. It be create by a singularly gift man , who have master his business * * * and it success have be richly deserved. '' Yet when the conductor Artur Rodzinski ask Mr. Kern for a symphonic arrangement the latter demur at first on the ground that he be n't sufficiently well equipped. Mr. Kern be a small , jovial man , with white hair and keen blue eye behind horn-rimmed glasses. He speak in sporadic outburst and have a tremendous amount of nervous energy. He be an avid collector of rare book , and at one time it be say that he be well know in the bookshop than in the mart of the musical trade. When , in January , 1929 , he dispose of his great collection because it have become too much of a responsibility , the library bring $ 1,729,462. The next day he pass a bookshop , saw a rare volume and buy it -- out of habit , he be suppose to have confessed. Mother Taught Him Piano He be bear in New York , Jan. 27 , 1885 , on Sutton Place when it be the city 's brewery district. His first association with music come through his mother , who teach him to play the piano. After the usual schooling , his family send him abroad and he study composition in Germany and England.

Only veteran follower of show music probably can recall his first musical comedy here , `` Mr. Wix of Wickham , '' but one critic review the premiere stamp himself a prophet when he write , `` Who be this man Jerome Kern , whose music tower in an Eiffel way above the average primitive hurdy-gurdy accompaniment of our present-day musical comedy ? '' After that the name of Jerome Kern become a byword in the theatre. He do the music for `` The Red Petticoat , '' in 1911 , and from 1915 to 1918 do the score for at least nineteen productions. `` Sally , '' in 1920 , star the late Marilyn Miller and one of it hit tune be `` Look for the Silver Lining. '' Besides `` Show Boat , '' a partial listing of his musical would include , `` Roberts , '' `` Music in the Air , '' `` Cat and the Fiddle , '' `` Sweet Adeline , '' `` Sunny '' and `` The Girl from Utah. '' Story Behind `` Show Boat '' The idea for turn Edna Ferber 's novel , `` Show Boat , '' into a musical be credit to Mr. Kern. The late Alexander Woollcott use to prove the composer 's modesty by tell how Mr. Kern call him on the telephone one day after he have read the book to ask how he could meet Miss Ferber. Mr. Woollcott say Miss Ferber probably would be honor to meet Mr. Kern. The meeting be arrange and subsequently Oscar Hammerstein 2d be assign to write the lyrics. The December night that `` Show Boat '' open in 1927 speculator be say to have receive as much a $ 100 for a pair of tickets.

March 19 , 1986 OBITUARY Bernard Malamud Dies at 71 ; Chronicled Human Struggle By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN Bernard Malamud , the novelist and short story writer who win two National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prize for his chronicle of human struggle , die yesterday at his Manhattan apartment. He be 71 year old. Mr. Malamud 's work show a regard for Jewish tradition and the plight of ordinary men , and be imbue with the theme of moral wisdom gain through suffering. Mr. Malamud be consider by many critic to be one of the fine contemporary American writers. The critic Robert Alter say that story like `` The First Seven Years , '' `` The Magic Barrel , '' `` The Last Mohican , '' `` Idiots First '' and `` Angel Levine '' will be read `` as long a anyone continue to care about American fiction write in the 20th century. '' The author once describe himself a a chronicler of `` simple people struggle to make their life well in a world of bad luck. '' One of his last appearance be at the PEN Congress in New York in January where he read from his works. In his work , Mr. Malamud often combine fantasy and reality to create a world that be both the same and different from the one we live in. In `` Angel Levine , '' a black , rather seedy-looking angel appear to a retired Jewish tailor ; in `` The Jewbird , '' a Yiddish-accented vagabond make his way into an urban Jewish household in the form of a crow ; in `` Idiots First , '' the Angel of Death , alias Ginzburg , pursue a desperate Jew try to scrape together money to send his idiot son to California on the midnight train. `` Malamud have be in the fable business , so to speak , '' the critic Alan Lelchuk wrote. Mr. Malamud 's first novel , `` The Natural , '' an allegory about the rise and fall of a baseball player , be publish in 1952. It be different from most of his work in that there be no Jewish characters. After the book be make into a movie star Robert Redford in 1984 , Mr. Malamud say in an interview that he be grateful for the film because it allow him `` to be recognize once more a an American writer '' a oppose to a Jewish writer. But `` The Natural '' be similar to his late novel and story in that it lie in the realm of a morality play. `` Malamud have always have a fondness for tell tale arrange for the purpose of a specific moral lesson , '' Mr. Lelchuk wrote. `` Neither realism nor surrealism have be his forte through the year , '' he continue , `` but the fable , the parable , the allegory , the ancient art of basic storytelling in a modern voice ; through this special mode he have earn his high place in contemporary letters. '' `` The Assistant , '' his second novel , and the one many critic consider his best , be publish in 1957. Set in the Depression , it tell of a Jewish grocery store owner and his Italian assistant , and it , too , be much like a morality play. `` The Fixer '' ( 1966 ) be inspire by the ordeal of Mendel Beiliss , a Jew try and acquit of ritual murder in Kiev in czarist Russia of 1913. `` The Magic Barrel , '' the author 's first collection of short story , be give the National Book Award in 1959. On the basis of `` The Assistant '' and `` The Fixer , '' critic begin to think of Mr. Malamud a a `` Jewish writer '' along with Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. Mr. Malamud , however , say that he find the label of `` Jewish writer '' inadequate. He say that the three writer share more difference than similarity , and that , in his case , Jewishness be more a spiritual than a cultural or a religious quality. `` I be concern with what Jews stand for , '' he say , `` with their get down to the bare bone of things. I be concern with their ethicality - how Jews felt they have to live in order to go on living. '' And at another time he comment : `` Jewishness be important to me , but I do n't consider myself only a Jewish writer. I have interest beyond that , and I feel I 'm write for all men. '' Mr. Roth agree with Mr. Malamud. `` The Jews of 'The Magic Barrel ' and the Jews of 'The Assistant ' be not the Jews of New York City or Chicago , '' Mr. Roth wrote. `` They be Malamud 's invention , a metaphor of sort to stand for certain possibility and promises. '' Later Works Criticized Mr. Malamud 's later work - `` Pictures of Fidelman , '' `` The Tenants , '' `` God 's Grace '' and to a less extent , `` Dubin's Lives '' - get mixed reviews. Many critic cite a grow bleakness in his work , say that a he leave his Jewish milieu for academic and other setting his work take on a flinty emptiness without the poignance and meaning that characterize his early novels. His argument with God , they say , seem to wither into a seminar. Others , however , saw a growth in these work - his handling in `` The Tenants '' of the cultural and psychological upheaval among black cause by the rise of nationalism , separatism and racial pride ; the powerful presence of nature in `` Dubin 's Lives , '' something new for an author whose work for the most part have urban setting , and the concern with man 's survival in the nuclear age in `` God 's Grace. '' Bernard Malamud be bear April 26 , 1914 , in Brooklyn , the eldest of two son of Russian Jewish immigrant , Max Malamud and the former Bertha Fidelman. His father run a small grocery , work 16 hour a day - he serve a a model for the Jewish grocer in `` The Assistant. '' Looking back on his childhood , Mr. Malamud would recall that there be no book in his home , no cultural nourishment at all except that on Sundays he would listen to someone else 's piano through the living room window. He attend Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn , and in 1936 he receive his B.A. from the City College of New York. After graduation , he work in a factory , in various store and a a clerk in the Census Bureau in Washington , write in his spare time. Began Teaching High School In 1940 , he get a job teach at Erasmus Hall Evening High School , and he would continue to teach in New York City even high school until 1949. While he be teach , he earn an M.A. at Columbia University in 1942. Mr. Malamud often say that the advent of World War II and the Holocaust first make him sure that he have something to say a a writer. Until then , he say , he have not give much think to what it mean to be Jewish , but the horror of the war - as well a the fact that he have marry a gentile woman , Ann de Chiara , in 1945 - make him question his own identity a a Jew and compel him to start read about Jewish tradition and history. He know then , he say , that he really want to write. `` The suffering of the Jews be a distinct thing for me , '' he once explained. `` I for one believe that not enough have be make of the tragedy of the destruction of six million Jews. Somebody have to cry - even if it 's a writer , 20 year later. '' In 1949 , he get a job teach English at Oregon state University , where he stay until 1961 , become an associate professor. He write four book there - `` The Natural , '' `` The Assistant , '' `` The Magic Barrel '' and his third novel , `` A New Life '' ( 1961 ) , which be set in the Pacific Northwest at a college not unlike Oregon State. In 1961 , he go to teach at Bennington College in Vermont , where he teach for more than 20 year , with the exeception of two year he spend a a visiting lecturer at Harvard from 1966 to 1968. In 1963 , he publish `` Idiots First , '' another story collection. That be follow by `` The Fixer '' ( 1966 ) , `` Pictures of Fidelman , '' stories about one central character ( 1969 ) ; `` The Tenants , '' a novel about the conflict between two writer , one Jewish and the other black ( 1971 ) ; `` Rembrandt 's Hat , '' more story ( 1973 ) ; `` Dubin 's Lives , '' a novel about a biographer in midlife that many critic consider one of his best ( 1979 ) ; `` God 's Grace , '' a novel ( 1982 ) , and `` The Stories of Bernard Malamud '' ( 1983 ) . 'Story , Story , Story' Mr. Malamud be a firm believer that a story should tell a story. `` With me , it 's story , story , story , '' he once said. `` Writers who ca n't invent story often pursue other strategy , even substitute style for narrative. I feel that story be the basic element of fiction though that ideal be not popular with disciple of the 'new novel. ' They remind me of the painter who could n't paint people , so he paint chairs. `` The story will be with u as long a man is. You know that , in part , because of it effect on children. It 's through story they realize that mystery wo n't kill them. Through story they learn they have a future. '' He do not find write an easy task. `` The idea be to get the pencil move quickly , '' he said. `` Once you 've get some word look back at you you can take two or three - or throw them away and look for other. I go over and over a page. Either it bleed and show it 's begin to be human , or the form emit shadow of itself and I 'm off. I have a terrifying will that way. '' In his writing , he prize the idea of swift transition - change a scene in one sentence between paragraph -and he think he might have achieve that talent by study intercutting in motion pictures. `` I be influence very much by Charlie Chaplin movie , '' he say , `` by the rhythm and snap of his comedy and his wonderful , wonderful mixture of comedy and sadness. '' He acknowledge that sadness be one of his prime topics. `` People say I write so much about misery , '' he say , but add , `` you write about what you write best. '' He describe the essential Malamud character a `` someone who fear his fate , be catch up in it , yet manage to outrun it ; he 's the subject and object of laughter and pity. '' In addition to the Pulitzer and the National Book Awards , Mr. Malamud win the Rosenthal Award of the National Institute of Arts and Letters , Vermont 's 1979 Governor 's Award for Excellence in the Arts and the 1981 Brandeis Creative Arts Award. He be a member of the American Academy and institute of Arts and Letters , which in 1983 present him it Gold Medal in Fiction. From 1979 to 1981 he be president of the PEN American Center. For many year , Mr. Malamud do not become involved in social issue , argue that for an author writing be involvement enough. But a president of PEN , he protest the repression of writer in the Soviet Union and South Africa and the curtailing of First Amendment rights. Although he grant occasional interview , Mr. Malamud lead an intensely private life. In `` The Ghost Writer , '' Philip Roth create a character name E. I. Lonoff , a novelist `` deeply skeptical of the public world , '' whose idea of work and esthetic purity oblige him to live a life of solitude. A number of critic have suggest that Lonoff be a portrait of Mr. Malamud. Mr. Roth be a good friend of Mr. Malamud , and it be perhaps he who best sum up Mr. Malamud 's work. Noting that Mr. Malamud be once suppose to have remark that `` all men be Jews , '' Mr. Roth say : `` What it be to be human , and to be humane , be his deepest concern.' He be survive by his wife , and by his son Paul and his daughter Janna .

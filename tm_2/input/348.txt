'' He write that when the Cronyns act together , it be `` a matter of heart , mind and body in creative harmony. '' One of their last project together be `` To Dance With the White Dog , '' a television movie that have it premiere last year.

'' Miss Tandy be nominate five time for a Tony and win three : in 1948 for her role a Blanche Dubois , for `` The Gin Game '' in 1978 , and for `` Foxfire '' in 1983. Mr. Cronyn be also nominate for `` The Gin Game '' but do not win. `` I be bitterly disappointed , '' Miss Tandy said. `` His performance be part of mine. I think he 's very proud when I win , and vice versa. '' In July 1994 they be honor with a special Tony for their life 's work in the theater. They have already receive the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal , in December 1986 , and the National Medal of Art , from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature Miss Tandy act in more than 100 stage production during her 67-year career , which begin in England and encompass the West End in London as well a the British province , Broadway , and the regional theater that be once so important to the American stage. She appear in more than 25 movie and play the leading role in a number of television program , develop from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft , a star adore by director for her serenity. There be no temperament ; there be no tantrums. Elia Kazan , her director in `` Streetcar '' say : `` She 's absolutely sweet-natured. She do her job ; she have a sense of humor. '' With each performance her review get better. `` I think I 've get well , '' she say when she be 77. `` I 've get more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrust myself. I 'd be in thing I felt be n't be do right and I do n't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me. '' Miss Tandy , who become an American citizen in 1954 , be bear in London on June 7 , 1909. Her father die when she be 12 and her mother take clerical and teach job at night to supplement her regular income a headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two old brother be read to a lot , Miss Tandy recall in 1986 : `` good stuff , poetry. '' `` I have an appreciation of the words. We be also take to theater. I sit in a lot of galleries. It be a magical time , but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never want it to end. '' She also grow to love Shakespeare , one of the few in her class who did. `` Almost everyone would say , 'Oh , God , it 's Shakespeare this afternoon. ' To me it be heaven. '' Her brother would stage family theatrical in their five-room flat in northeast London , but she say she do not show any promise. `` I be a graceless lump , '' she recalled. `` My brother would always say , 'Oh , Mummy , do we really have to have her in it ? ' `` Nevertheless , her love of the theater lead her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where , in 1924 , she begin three year of dramatic training. She be 18 when she make her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in `` The Manderson Girls. '' The salary be & # 163 ; 2 a week , out of which she somehow have to pay for the five elegant costume her part required. She manage by sew them herself. Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling She be convince that she be plain and that there be nothing to be do about it. `` I have absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I do , '' she said. Her self-confidence be not enhance by her many letter of recommendation. She remember that each one of them say , `` Do n't be put off by how she looks. '' But if she ever be an ugly duckling -- and there be many photograph that suggest she be not -- a swan finally emerge , for in her late year she be a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkle eye of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically , say : `` In a way it be rather good. I do n't get the part of the young ingenue. I get more interesting parts. '' In 1929 she make her West End debut in `` The Rumor , '' by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro , but it be in 1932 , in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe 's `` Children in Uniform , '' that she become recognize a a gifted actress. It be a role that also afford her one of her most treasured moment in the theater. `` There be one performance when the audience do n't clap at all , they be so move , '' she recalled. During the 1930 's she appear in more than two dozen contemporary play , but in the English tradition hone her skill on the classic , especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she be Ophelia to John Gielgud 's legendary Hamlet. She be Viola in Tyrone Guthrie 's 1937 production of `` Twelfth Night '' at the Old Vic in London , where she twice share the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940 , she return to the Old Vic a Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear. The offer of a role in `` The Matriarch '' bring her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten year later , when the war in Europe have begin and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins be end , she settle in the United States. There be the lure of Hollywood , and there be the need to support her 6-year-old daughter , Susan. She be allow to take only & # 163 ; 10 out of the country , and despite her long list of credit , it be such a struggle to make end meet that she almost abandon the stage. In 1940 , while she be appear in A. J. Cronin 's `` Jupiter Laughs , '' a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn call on her backstage. Two year later they move to Hollywood and be married. A son , Chris , be bear in 1943 and a daughter , Tandy , in 1945. They , her daughter Susan , five grandchild and three great-grandchildren survive her , in addition to her husband. Maids ' Roles Ended , Thanks to Cronyn In Hollywood , Mr. Cronyn land some interesting role in the movie , but Miss Tandy 's career languished. At one point she even tell friend she be think of give up acting. She appear with Mr. Cronyn in `` The Seventh Cross '' ( 1944 ) and play bit part in several other movie , include the role of a lady ' maid in `` Forever Amber '' ( 1947 ) , but have to say line like `` Yes , Mum '' and 'No , Mum '' in yet another movie become very discourage , she recall many year later. `` I 'd have a good start and I be in the doldrums in Hollywood , '' she said. `` It be not a happy position. I begin to feel I have no talent and it be all a pipe dream. It be Hume who get me out of it. '' He get her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in `` Portrait of a Madonna , '' a play by Tennessee Williams that he be direct in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave review bring Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York , where he be cast his new play , `` A Streetcar Named Desire. '' He write in his `` Memoirs , '' `` It be instantly apparent to me that Jessica be Blanche. '' The play , co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter a Blanche 's sister , Stella , win rapturous review , a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and run for more than two year on Broadway before go on a national tour. Years later , Mr. Kazan remember the joy of direct Miss Tandy. `` She 's perfect , '' he said. `` She never stop work and she 's always full of little surprises. She always do thing a little good than you think she will. '' Mr. Atkinson , write about Miss Tandy 's performance in The New York Times , say , `` It do seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shade and impulse that be accurate , reveal and true. '' A contrary view be express by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently publish autobiography. In `` Brando : Songs My Mother Taught Me , '' the actor write : `` I think Jessica and I be both miscast , and between u we throw the play out of balance. Jessica be a very good actress , but I never think she be believable a Blanche. I do n't think she have the finesse or cultivate femininity that the part require , nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned. '' When `` Streetcar '' be film , the part of Blanche go to Vivien Leigh ; it be the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script She say that in create a character , `` You have to get over 'how ' you 're do it and know 'why ' you 're do it. Once you forget about the 'how ' you get the appearance of reality. '' She believe the secret to a character be in the script and that it be the actor 's duty to `` dig it out. '' She say : `` I 'm slow about it. I keep go back to the script , the script , the script. '' To Miss Tandy , audience reaction be part of a play. She say , `` It 's not a matter of whether they 're laugh or not but whether they 're breathe or not. '' But audience , like the theater itself , underwent profound change during Miss Tandy 's year on the stage. `` The trouble with the theater , '' she say in 1986 , `` be that it 's no longer a way of life for an audience. It 's just a way to kill an evening. '' One of the theater 's problem , she say , be `` we be so inundated with entertainment. '' `` Now you flick a switch , '' she continued. `` It 's not the event it use to be. '' She say theater people have contribute to the problem by remove the curtain. `` People come into the theater and they sit there watch the first scene and talk about what they 've buy in Bloomingdale 's that day. When you have a curtain , when the footlights go up on the curtain , and then the curtain itself go up , you be part of an experience. '' As for the actor , Miss Tandy say she hat to have to grope her way across a dark stage , stumble into the furniture , `` instead of get on stage and have a moment to think about what you 're go to do. '' Joe Mankiewicz , the film director who be a longtime friend , say that while Lynn Fontanne always have to make an entrance , `` to Jessie the way she be when she get there be what be important. '' Loved to Play In the Classics Miss Tandy be always eager to perform in regional theater and , with Mr. Cronyn , be among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launch his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of star of their magnitude help put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who follow be the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie 's first season in 1963 , for example , Miss Tandy play Gertrude in Hamlet , Olga in `` The Three Sisters '' and the wife of Willy Loman in `` Death of a Salesman. '' She also act in the Shakespeare festival in Stratford , Conn. , and Stratford , Ontario. In 1983 she star in a revival of an American classic , Tennessee Williams 's `` Glass Menagerie. '' Frank Rich write in The New York Times , `` You pass up Miss Tandy 's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril. '' She hat the experience of see herself in the movies. `` It 's a very humbling experience to watch yourself , '' she said. But while the satisfaction of film never come close to the joy of a live performance , she say she felt it be important to accept role that be offer to her ; it help pay expense when she take part at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She play Mr. Cronyn 's wife in four of her most recent film , `` Honky Tonk Freeway , '' ( 1981 ) `` Cocoon , '' ( 1984 ) , `` Batteries Not Included '' ( 1987 ) and `` Cocoon : The Return '' ( 1988 ) . In 1991 , Miss Tandy , then 82 , play an indomitable 82-year-old woman in `` Fried Green Tomatoes. '' Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 play on Broadway and dozen of Off Broadway and regional production during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they go they be ask how they tolerate so much togetherness. `` It 's hard sometimes , '' she acknowledge , `` but we always manage to give ourselves space. We do n't live in each other 's pockets. We do n't take the play home with us. We do make suggestion to each other , and if we do n't agree we respect each other 's views. '' She burst out laughing and recall Dame Sybil Thorndike 's response when ask whether she ever consider divorce her husband , with whom she have long share the stage. `` Divorce ? Never. Murder ? Frequently. '' In her 70 's and even into her 80 's , Miss Tandy continue to take on strenuous part , despite increase difficulty with memorization and stage fright that have get worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that cause her collapse onstage during a performance of `` Foxfire '' in Los Angeles in 1985 do not slow her down. Nor do major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appear in the television movie `` The Story Lady '' ( 1991 ) and `` To Dance With the White Dog '' ( 1993 ) and complete three more feature film : `` Used People '' ( 1992 ) and `` Camilla '' and `` Nobody 's Fool , '' which be to be release this fall. `` Jessie adore work , '' Mr. Cronyn say in 1986. `` She 's more fully alive when she 's working. '' As she get old she seem to be in ever great demand , but over the year she take good part and she take bad parts. `` You be rich for do thing , '' she said. `` If you wait for the perfect part or for what send you , you will have long wait , and you deteriorate. You ca n't be an actor without acting. '' A Dedicated Life in the Public Eye During a 67-year act career in Britain and the United States , Jessica Tandy appear in more than 100 play , more than 25 movie and numerous television shows.

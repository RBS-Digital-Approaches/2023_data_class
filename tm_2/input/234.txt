June 10 , 1974 OBITUARY Katharine Cornell Is Dead at 81 By ALDEN WHITMAN Katharine Cornell , one of the great actress of the American theater , die of pneumonia early yesterday at her home in Vineyard Haven , Mass. , on Martha 's Vineyard. She be 81 year old. A memorial service be be plan for next week in Vineyard Haven 's Association Hall , the 300-year-old former Town Hall that Miss Cornell help restore. Her body will be cremate in Boston tomorrow. `` The First Lady of the Theater '' be Alexander Woollcott 's phrase for Katharine Cornell. Uttered with that critic 's usual hyperbole , the description be nonetheless apt , for Miss Cornell be indisputably a reign Broadway star of the second quarter of the century , an actress without peer in emotional , romantic role , and one , moreover , who take her play to the byway and crossroad of America , thereby help to shape the country 's cultural tastes. With Helen Hayes and Lynn Fontanne , her contemporary and rival , Miss Cornell epitomize the artistry of acting. She represent the theater of quality in such drama a `` The Barretts of Wimpole Street , '' `` Romeo and Juliet '' and `` Candida '' -- her three great triumphs. More than triumph of win and hold audience , of excite them and dazzle them and illuminate them. One of Miss Cornell 's strength a an artist be her ability to create character. Many of the play she appear in be weak or flaw -- '' The Green Hat , '' for example -- but she could transform the material and create the illusion that the viewer be witness a memorable play. Part of this be her acting genius and part her looks. Her face , with it high cheekbone , be somewhat Oriental in cast ; her hair be dark brown ( almost black ) and her prominent eyebrows curve down toward her cheeks. It be a mobile and expressive face , one that captivate , among others , Bernard Shaw. `` I do n't think I be ever so astonish by a picture a I be by your photograph , '' the British playwright wrote. `` Your success a Candida , and something blonde and expansive about your name , have create an ideal suburban British Candida in my imagination. `` Fancy my feeling on see in your photograph a gorgeous dark lady from the cradle of the human race -- wherever that be -- Ceylon , Sumatra , Hilo , or the southernmost corner of the Garden of Eden ! '' A Director 's Comments Miss Cornell 's professional and private life be bind up with Guthrie McClintic. When she make her Broadway debut in 1921 in `` Nice People , '' Mr. McClintic , then a young casting director , saw her and write in his notebook , `` Interesting. Monotonous. Watch. '' Not only do he observe her but also by early fall he have marry her. The union be a championship that last for 40 year until Mr. McClintic 's death in 1961. In that time he direct her play and help to mold her abundant talents. At his death she leave the stage , for she felt that act without him would be too difficult. `` If not for Guthrie , I think I would have continue just drifting , '' Miss Cornell remark many year later. `` He want to be an actor and my career be a sublimation of his desire , because he could pour his talent through me and that be a great advantage to me. `` I continue in the theater buoy up mostly by his enthusiasm for it. He be one of those people who fascinate you always. You be never bore ; sometimes upset , but never bored. '' As well a hearten critical success , the actress have a number of discomforting failure -- among them Jean Anouilh 's `` Antigone , '' Christopher Fry 's `` The First Born '' and S. N. Behrman 's `` No Time for Comedy. '' Her feel for comedy be limit , and she have an unhappy tendency to throw away laugh , in the critic John Mason Brown 's phrase , `` as profligately a Madame Ranevsky throw away money. '' Lusty or romantic woman be more to Miss Cornell 's aptitude. Her first star role be Iris March , the lose but sexually hearty heroine of Michael Arlen 's `` The Green Hat , '' which be produce in 1925. For several year she be the femme fatale in such melodrama a `` The Letter '' and `` Dishonored Lady. '' Formed Producing Unit In the thirty , however , she all but drop that role for straight romance , a step that coincide with the establishment of her produce association , call Katharine Cornell Presents. Its first play , in 1931 , be Rudolf Besier 's `` The Barretts of Wimpole Street , '' the courtship and elopement of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning. Revived five time , it fix Miss Cornell in theatergoer ' mind a a romantic actress. Describing the play and Miss Cornell 's impact at the time , Brooks Atkinson , The New York Times drama critic , write on open night : `` [ The play ] introduces u to Katharine Cornell a an actress of the first order. Here the disciplined fury she have be squander on catch-penny play become the vibrant beauty of finely wrought character. `` By the crescendo of her playing , by the wild sensitivity that lurk behind her ardent gesture and her piercing stare across the footlights she charge the drama with a meaning beyond the fact it records. Her acting be quite a remarkable for the carefulness of it design a for the fire of her presence. '' `` The Barretts '' ran for a year on Broadway , and then Miss Cornell shepherd her company on a 20,853-mile tour of the United States , a daring venture in the Depression. They perform repertory in 77 city and town -- place like Thomasville , Ga. ; Amarillo , Tex. , and Portland , Me. The play , in addition to `` The Barretts , '' be `` Candida '' and `` Romeo and Juliet. '' `` We open up the road , '' Miss Cornell said. `` We make 'The Barretts ' and 'Candida ' pay for Shakespeare. 'The Barretts ' never play to an empty house -- the receipt would be something like $ 33,000 , then about $ 28,000 for 'Candida ' and for 'Juliet ' about $ 18,000 to $ 19,000 , so that we come back have more than broken even. We really felt prideful. `` We continue like that for many year , alternatively New York with the road , pay for ourselves with Sidney Howard 's 'Alien Corn , ' Shaw 's 'St. Joan ' and 'The Doctor 's Dilemma ' and some of the others -- until later on , when cost get too high with 'Anthony and Cleopatra , ' we have to call in angels. '' The Audience Waited Miss Cornell 's hold on her audience be astonishing. One Christmas Day the troupe be on it way from Montana to Seattle for a week 's engagement opening that evening. Floods delay the train , and at curtain time the actor be far from Seattle and resign to miss the performance -- and their pay for it. The train finally arrive at 11:15 , and the group discover that the audience be still waiting. The curtain rise at 1:05 , and Mr. Woollcott , who be present , describe the experience : `` The excitement , the heady compliment pay by the audience in have wait at all , act like wine on the spirit of the troupe and they give the kind of performance one hop for on great occasion and never gets. '' The actress 's skill on the stage be all the more remarkable because she be usually nervous and fidgety before she go on. `` I be nervous from the very beginning and it get worse a the year go on , '' she once confess , add : `` I be conscientious and want to do more , always , than I be able. I do n't think , when I be play , that I be ever happy -- begin at 4 o'clock any afternoon. '' Born in Berlin Katharine Cornell 's bent for act be familial , since both her grandfather and her father be both actor manque. She be the only child of Dr. Peter C. and Alice Cornell , and she be bear in Berlin , where her father be study surgery. The precise date be a mystery. For year she say it be Feb. 16 , 1898 ; but when she be in her 70 's she offer the year a 1893 , explain : `` When an actress be young she like to lower her age , but when she be old she like to add to her years. '' In any event , Katharine have an early exposure to the theater in Buffalo , where the family live for many year and where her father quit medicine to manage a playhouse. `` I drift into acting , '' she once remarked. `` My grandfather have a house in Buffalo in which there be a stage and his friend meet every two week or so to put on plays. `` So it be natural for met to put on play too when I go to board school. I put on everything in the drama -- I be indiscriminate. I put on Yeats and Shaw and Lady Gregory. '' Her first professional opportunity come when the director of the Washington Square Players visit her school in Mamaroneck , N.Y. , to do a play. Recalling the occasion , Miss Cornell say : `` [ Eddie Goodman ] tell me to come and see him if I ever want a job. When I do , he give me a part in 'Bushido , ' a No drama they be put on. All I get to say be 'My son , my son ' ; it be a very exciting moment when they tell me I could have the part. That be in 1917. `` I sort of slid from one thing to another after that. I be with the Jessie Bonstelle Stock Company in Detroit and Buffalo for three season -- 10 performance and a new play every week. She be an amazing woman who do a great deal for me. '' One of the thing Miss Bonstelle do for Miss Cornell be to take her to London a Jo in `` Little Women. '' She be see there by , among others , two Scottish woman who urge her upon Allen Pollock , a producer , who be search for an actress for Clemence Dane 's `` A Bill of Divorcement , '' to be present in New York. She get the part of an ingenue , and she have a personal triumph when the play open in 1921. It run for two seasons. After appear in some indifferent drama , she do the title role in `` Candida '' in 1924 to critical raves. One of them read : `` The tenderness , the poetry , the supreme womanliness of Katharine Cornell 's impersonation of the title part put this actress a notch ahead of anything she have yet attempted. It be an impersonation touch by the wand of genius. '' Then there be `` The Green Hat '' and assure stardom status that pull through such dubious drama a `` Dishonored Lady '' and `` The Age of Innocence '' in the late twenties. Whatever the role , Miss Cornell decline to have retrospective regrets. `` The audience may not have felt it be right and the author may have felt a little upset , but every part I 've play I 've twist around in my mind until I 've make it into something of my own , '' she said. `` Looking back over it , I do n't deliberately sit down and plan like that , but it do read like it. '' Most of her play be choose by her husband , `` who give me the confidence needed. '' `` Guthrie persuade me to do Shakespeare and I be very frightened of Shakespeare , she remark , add : `` There be some play we never get around to doing. Shaw 's 'Heartbreak House , ' for example , but I simply could not find my way through to Mrs. Hushye. I could n't connect with her. We keep around any number of version of 'The Cherry Orchard ' and never do anything about that either. '' She do one Chekhov play , however , `` The Three Sisters , '' in which she bring together Judith Anderson , Ruth Gordon , Alexander Knox and Edmund Gwenn. It run for 230 performance in the season of 1942-43. Indeed , Miss Cornell be generous in select her supporting cast , which over the year include Marlon Brando , Brian Aherne , Charles Boyer , Grace George , Tyrone Power , Gregory Peck , Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier. Diminished Dazzle In the fifty , toward the end of her career , Miss Cornell seem to many observer to have a diminished dazzle. `` The Dark Is Light Enough , '' `` The First Born '' and `` Dear Liar '' do not draw the oohs and aahs of her previous plays. The actress be reluctant to appear on radio or television. She do act for them , but they be not her media. For year Miss Cornell and her husband live in a house on Beekman Place. Then in 1951 they move to Sneden 's Landing , N.Y. , and after Mr. McClintic 's death she give up that house for a summer place on Martha 's Vineyard and a small house in New York. For her acting and her contribution to the stage , the actress receive dozen of award and honorary degrees. A room at the New York Public Library 's theater collection at Lincoln Center be dedicate to her and her husband. And she be give the National Artists Award of the American National Theater and Academy , a gold medal , on which ironically , her first name be spell `` Katherine. '' The citation be less in error , for it laud her `` incomparable acting ability and her theatrical genius '' and say that she have `` elevate the theater throughout the world . ''

February 16 , 1984 OBITUARY Ethel Merman , Queen of Musicals , Dies at 76 By MURRAY SCHUMACH Ethel Merman , the musical-comedy star whose belting voice and brassy style entertain Broadway and movie audience for 50 year , be find dead in her Manhattan apartment yesterday. Miss Merman , who be 76 year old , have undergone surgery to remove a brain tumor last April. The Medical Examiner 's office report yesterday that she die of natural causes. The singer 's booming voice be first hear on a Broadway stage in 1930 when she bring down the house sing `` I Got Rhythm '' in the Gershwin musical `` Girl Crazy. '' Her last major appearance in New York be in 1982 , when she take part in a Carnegie Hall benefit concert. Miss Merman 's most memorable show include Cole Porter 's `` Anything Goes '' and `` Dubarry Was a Lady , '' Irving Berlin 's `` Annie Get Your Gun '' and the Jule Styne-Stephen Sondheim musical `` Gypsy , '' which she consider her best. Her 14 movie include `` Alexander 's Ragtime Band , '' `` There 's No Business Like Show Business '' and `` It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World. '' Beginning in 1930 , and for more than a quarter of a century thereafter , no Broadway season seem really complete unless it have a musical with Ethel Merman. In that period , the chunky , aggressive star with the clarion voice , brash personality , shrewd comic sense and steel nerve be the darling of such master songwriter a George Gershwin , Irving Berlin , Cole Porter and Jule Styne. When her Broadway career all but end in 1959 with what many of her admirer consider her fine performance , a the mother of the stripper in `` Gypsy , '' she have do 13 musical , nearly all of them hits. She return for a brief run , in 1966 , of an `` Annie Get Your Gun '' revival , and although the critic cheer her still-powerful voice , they question the wisdom of a 59-year-old playing a lovestruck girl. In 1970 , she be the last of the six star who play the title role in Jerry Herman 's `` Hello , Dolly ! '' In 1964 , she have turn down the role and it go to Carol Channing. Miss Merman make 14 movie , some of them base on her Broadway triumph , have her own radio show and score a huge national success in 1953 in a television special team with Mary Martin , perhaps the only Broadway musical star of her stature at the time. But it be on Broadway that Miss Merman belonged. Composers vie for her , know she would hit every note on the mark , hold it as long a need , give it the right shading , follow the trickiest rhythm flawlessly. Lyrics writer be equally certain that she would make every syllable distinct and evoke every bit of laughter from a comic line. Instant Nostalgia Her delight customer know that when the `` belter '' strode onstage , turn her round eye on them , raise her quizzical eyebrow and open her wide mouth , they would get full value wherever they sat. She need no hidden microphones. Equally important , they know that when they buy ticket for a Merman show - usually well in advance - she would be there , her face beaming , strong arm churning , regardless of snowfall or flu epidemic. Her health be as legendary a her toughness and outspokenness. In any gathering of showgoers , merely to mention a Merman show be enough to touch off a wave of nostalgia in which people begin recall - perhaps even sing - her hits. They include Gershwin 's `` I Got Rhythm , '' from `` Girl Crazy '' ; `` Eadie Was a Lady , '' from `` Take a Chance '' ; `` Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries '' by Lew Brown and Ray Henderson , from the 1931 `` George White 's Scandals '' ; `` Blow , Gabriel , Blow , '' `` I Get a Kick Out of You '' and `` You 're the Top , '' from Porter 's `` Anything Goes '' ; `` Ridin ' High , '' from Porter 's `` Red , Hot and Blue '' ; `` Friendship , '' from Porter 's `` DuBarry Was a lady '' ; `` Let 's Be Buddies , '' from Porter 's `` Panama Hattie '' ; `` Doin ' What Comes Natur'lly , '' `` You Ca n't Get a Man With a Gun , '' `` They Say It 's Wonderful '' and `` I Got the Sun in the Morning , '' from Berlin 's `` Annie Get Your Gun '' ; `` The Hostess With the Mostes ' on the Ball '' and `` You 're Just in Love , '' from Berlin 's `` Call Me Madam , '' and `` Rose 's Turn , '' from the Styne-Sondheim score for `` Gypsy. '' Her film include `` We 're Not Dressing , '' `` Kid Millions , '' `` Strike Me Pink , '' `` Alexander 's Ragtime Band , '' `` There 's No Business Like Show Business '' and the Hollywood version of `` Anything Goes '' and `` Call Me Madam. '' A self-taught singer , Miss Merman do not try to analyze her technique or style. When ask to explain her success , she say : `` I just stand up and holler and hope my voice hold out. '' Or : `` I leave the song the way they come out of the composer 's head. '' Or : `` Even if I do n't know how I get the effect I end up with , I do have sense enough to know that I do all right. I 'd be a dope if I do n't know that. I 'd be even dopey if I change the way I do it. '' `` She 's the best , '' Irving Berlin once say of her. `` You give her a bad song , and she 'll make it sound good. Give her a good song , and she 'll make it sound great. And you 'd better write her a good lyric. The guy in the last row of the second balcony be go to hear every syllable. '' Turned Down Berlin 's Revisions Offstage , as well a in the theater , Miss Merman be a sort of symbol of the Broadway of her era , with her New York speech , gaudy jewelry , flamboyant , gum-chewing manner. Supremely self-confident , immune to opening- night jitter , she be in awe of no one in show business. For example , there be the time when `` Call Me Madam '' be approach it Broadway opening. Miss Merman , a usual , have let it be know even before rehearsal begin that she would allow no change in her song less than a week before opening. A few day before the opening , however , Mr. Berlin rush up to her with change in lyric for `` The Hostess With the Mostes ' on the Ball. '' Miss Merman bluntly turn down the multimillionaire songwriter , say : `` Call me Miss Bird 's Eye. It 's frozen. '' Once , when ask about her reputation for ruthlessness , she reply : `` I believe in assert myself , but only for thing that be important. Anybody who 's worth her salt have to fight for her right once in a while or get shove around. '' Miss Merman work hard during rehearsal and do not lower her standard during a long run. She demand - and get - as much a 10 percent of the gross. 'Gypsy ' Role Was Her Favorite `` When I do a show , '' she say , `` not to pat myself on the back , but when I do a show , the whole show revolve around me. And if I do n't show up , they can just forget it. '' Sometimes Miss Merman exercise considerable control over a show before it go into production. This be the case with `` Gypsy. '' Jerome Robbins , the director , want Mr. Sondheim to write the music. Miss Merman felt he be too inexperienced , and insist on Mr. Styne , who get the assignment. However , she agree to let Mr. Sondheim do the lyrics. Her role a Mama Rose in `` Gypsy '' be her favorite , she say year later , even though the character be largely unsympathetic. The Styne-Sondheim score climax with `` Mama's Turn , '' a complex , dramatic soliloquy that Miss Merman consider her most demanding moment in the theater , and some critic think be her finest. `` It be like an opera to sing , '' she said. `` It go on for about 11 minute , with tear , bump and grind , you name it. '' This hit lead to what be probably the big disappointment of her career. After `` Gypsy '' open , Mervyn LeRoy , the Hollywood producer-director , who be to do the film , saw the show many time and Miss Merman spend a good deal of time with him. She be convince that Mr. LeRoy have promise her the Broadway role in the movie. When she learn that the part be to be give to Rosalind Russell , she be furious. She get Mr. Styne on the phone , and accord to the book `` Sondheim & amp ; Co. , '' by Craig Zadan , demand , in abusive and profane language , that he get her the movie part. Miss Russell win out. Tale Began in 1930 The pattern for Miss Merman 's phenomenal success on Broadway begin with her first show , a performance that become part of Broadway 's colorful folklore. In 1930 , Miss Merman , barely 21 , with a few year of nightclub singing , be onstage at the Brooklyn Paramount. Word drift across the river about the big voice that be fill the Brooklyn movie theater during the stage show. Vinton Freedley , who be produce the new Gershwin show `` Girl Crazy , '' go to Brooklyn , hear her and persuade George Gershwin to audition her. The composer like her and hire her for the show , in which Willie Howard and Ginger Rogers get top billing. On open night , toward the end of the first act , the newcomer to Broadway swung into `` I Got Rhythm , '' rouse the savvy first-night audience with her power , rhythm and poise. She stop the show. As the curtain come down , Mr. Gershwin rush backstage and plead with her : `` Do n't ever let anyone give you a sing lesson. It 'll ruin you. '' No one ever did. 'It Was Exciting' Some year later , Miss Merman , by now an establish star , recall that night , say : `` In the second chorus of 'I Got Rhythm , ' I hold a high C note for 16 bar while the orchestra play the melodic line - a big , tooty thing - against the note. By the time I 'd hold that note for four bar the audience be applauding. They applaud through the whole chorus and I do several encores. It seem to do something to them. Not because it be sweet or beautiful , but because it be exciting. Few people have the ability to project a big note and hold it. It 's not just a matter of breath ; it 's a matter of power in the diaphragm. I 'd never train my diaphragm , but I must have a strong one. When I finish that song , a star have be born. Me. '' The star , whose real name be Ethel Agnes Zimmerman , be bear of German and Scottish parent on Jan. 16 , 1908 , or 1909 , or 1912 - the year change a she grow old - in the Astoria section of Queens. As a child , she begin traipse with her father to political club and lodge , where she sing such song a `` K-K-K-Katy , '' `` Maggie Dooley '' and `` How You Gon na Keep 'Em Down on the Farm. '' Even then her voice be big and her pitch true. Though she take a commercial course at high school and get a job a a stenographer , Miss Merman never doubt that she would become a singer. Thus , she leave one job for another because she have heard that her bos at the second job know important men in show business. Once her bos give her a letter to a Broadway producer who offer her a job in the chorus. She turn it down. She be determine to be a singer. When she go to the Palace with friend to watch the top performer in vaudeville , she would often imitate the singer and sometimes say she could sing good than the high-priced talent she have seen. 4 Marriages , 4 Divorces While work a a secretary , Miss Merman get a singing job at a small nightclub. An agent , Lou Irwin , get her a six-month contract to sing for Warner Brothers , but in fairly typical Hollywood fashion , the movie studio do not use her a a singer. She offer to waive her salary if the studio would let her sing elsewhere during her contract. The studio agree , and Miss Merman take nightclub jobs. Thus , for $ 85 a week , less than half what she could have receive from Warner Brothers for do nothing , she be sing at a New York nightclub run by Clayton , Jackson and Durante - the last name be Jimmy Durante. There she meet a pianist name Al Siegel , and the two get booking at Long Island night spots. And then she get the offer to sing at the Brooklyn Paramount. Later , she be headline at the New York Paramount and the Palace. Miss Merman 's personal life be much rocky than her professional career. Her four marriage all end in divorce. The first , to William B. Smith , be brief. She then marry Robert D. Levitt , a Hearst executive by whom she have two child , Ethel and Robert. The daughter commit suicide in 1967. Her third marriage be to Robert Six , then president of Continental Air Lines. The fourth be to Ernest Borgnine , the actor. Though Miss Merman be successful in every kind of show business she try , she never lose her partiality for Broadway. `` You may have do all right elsewhere , '' she say , `` but you have n't really do it until you face a New York first-night crowd. '' And , she say just over a year ago , `` Broadway have be very good to me - but then I 've be very good to Broadway. '' The Medical Examiner 's office say Miss Merman 's body would be cremate , and a spokesman for the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home say that no information about the singer 's death or possible memorial service would be release because of the wish of her son , Robert Levitt .

His Career a `` Glorifier '' Mr. Ziegfeld , know a the `` glorifier of the American girl , '' begin his career in professional theatrics with the profitable exploitation of the strong man , Eugene Sandow , a the `` perfect man. '' A number of year elapse between the time of his rise popularity at the Chicago World 's Fair in 1893 to the production of the first of the Ziegfeld `` Follies '' that run through twenty-two edition with more and more beautiful choruses. Perhaps , beneath the surface , the same idea underlay the two ; that of exhibit something so nearly perfect that people be attract by their own desire to admire. Mr. Ziegfeld be the son of Dr. Florenz Ziegfeld , who organize the Chicago Musical College , and recruit the symphony orchestra for Theodore Thomas. He be bear on March 21 , 1869 , and grow up against a background of Beethoven , Schumann and Bach. The young Ziegfeld have a flair for the theatre , and be constantly active in amateur promotions. His father seize the World 's Fair a an excellent excuse to give him a chance at the business in a professional way , send him to Europe to obtain performer for a program. The result be a German band , a group of Russian signer and dancer , a Hungarian string orchestra and an English singer. The combined effort of all of them produce nothing more than a financial failure. In New York the young Ziegfeld know Maurice Grau , grand opera impresario , have under contract Eugene Sandow. The `` perfect man '' Mr. Grau esteem a be worth $ 1,000 a week. Mr. Ziegfeld could not guarantee anybody $ 1,000 a week and so offer 10 per cent of the gross. The deal be make and Sandow go to the World 's Fair. The ability of the young manager a a glorifier be soon be used. One night Mrs. George Pullman and Mrs. Potter Palmer , leader in Chicago society , pay Sandow a visit in his dressing room. The fact of the visit make a newspaper story , and other prominent woman find similar visit a sort of social obligation. Sandow 's 10 per cent quickly run up to about $ 3,600 a week , and Mr. Ziegfeld 's esteem for publicity become practically ineradicable. Mr. Ziegfeld tire of be Sandow 's manager after about a year and a half , and come to New York. He bring Anna Held from Paris and present her in his first production , `` A Parlor Match , '' in 1896.

Miss Held continue in the leading role appear in `` Papa 's Wife , '' `` The Little Duchess , '' and `` Miss Innocence , '' and the Ziegfeld star be continually rising. Quits Temporarily a Producer At last it begin to wane. `` Red Feather , '' result in loss ; `` Higgledy-Piggledy , '' bring still more loss ; `` Pink Lady '' be only so-so , and finally `` Mlle. Napoleon '' be a disaster. Frantically try to stem the tide of reversal , for then , a he practically always do , Mr. Ziegfeld stag his show without backer , he come near the verge of nervous collapse.

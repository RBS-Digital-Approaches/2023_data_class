'' Was Trouper at 8 A trouper at the age of 8 and a successful songwriter before he be 21 , Mr. Cohan write both word and music , sing his own song and dance to them , and write his own play , direct them , star in them and produce them. He star in vaudeville , musical comedy , drama , on the screen and on the radio. He write more than fifty play , include several variety sketch , and hundred of song of every description. Every theatre-lover who saw his plays remembers them with pleasure. Some of the most popular be `` Little Johnny Jones , '' `` Forty-five Minutes From Broadway , '' `` Talk of New York , '' `` The Honeymooners , '' `` Broadway Jones , '' `` The Yankee Prince , '' `` The American Idea , '' `` Get Rich Quick Wallingford , '' `` The Man Who Owns Broadway , '' `` Little Nellie Kelley , '' `` Rise of Rose O'Reilly , '' `` The Song-and-Dance Man , '' `` Molly Malone , '' `` Hit-the-Trail Holliday , '' `` The Cohan Revue of 1916 , '' `` The Cohan Revue of 1918 , '' `` Seven Keys to Baldpate , '' `` The Miracle Man , '' `` Hello Broadway , '' `` Little Millionaire , '' `` Billie '' and `` Pigeons and People.

'' The last-named illustrated as well a a whole textbook one of the most effective of his stylist device in act and playwriting. He seldom fail to send an audience home laughing at his third- act ending. Collaborated on Dramas Mr. Cohan also collaborate with other writer on several successful drama , include `` Elmer the Great , '' `` The Tavern , '' `` Three Faces East , '' `` The Royal Vagabond , '' `` The Meanest Man in the World , '' `` The Tailor Made Man '' and `` The Beauty Shop. '' Mr. Cohan become a very rich man from his theatrical and songwriting enterprises. As he live simply , this give him an opportunity to play still another role , which be unknown to the general public but be very well know , indeed , along Broadway. He be probably the most generous man of his day in a profession note not only for it ups and down but for the generosity of those of it member who be `` in the money '' to those who be not. If an old actor ask him for a `` loan '' without get it , this never become known. On the other hand , his reputation a `` a soft touch '' be widespread. `` Okay , kid , '' be his favorite response to any approach. He have a long list of `` retainer '' and `` pensioner '' to whom he make regular allowance -- people who have act with him , have work for him , or have merely know his father and mother in show business. In at least one case , when a former partner be catch in the 1929 stock market crash , Mr. Cohan advance several hundred thousand dollar to save him. In private life also he be modest and soft-spoken , a far different person from the Broadway `` smart- aleck '' he often appear to be on the stage. Son of Vaudeville Troupers Born on July 4 , 1878 1 , in a little theatrical hotel in Providence , R.I. , amid the noise and celebration of the holiday , he be the son of Jeremiah and Helen Costigan Cohan , vaudeville trouper from away back. He have a sister , Josephine , and the whole family later become well know in vaudeville a `` the Four Cohans. '' George M. be first present to the public a a violinist , play second fiddle in an orchestra which accompany the tour of `` Daniel Boone. '' Then he make his appearance a a child prodigy of the violin , bill a `` Master Georgie -- violin trick and tinkle tune , '' and present himself in velveteen breeches. At 11 he be do a `` buck-and-wing '' dance in vaudeville , and two year later he be on tour a the star of `` Peck 's Bad Boy , '' in which he play the title role. Meanwhile his parent and sister be travel about the country with various road companies. In 1890 the family come together , and for the next ten year be bill a `` the Four Cohans , '' from Tony Pastor 's in New York to the old Orpheum in San Francisco , except for rare interval when they appear separately. On one of these occasion , George M. , at the age of 15 , make his Broadway debut at Keith 's , appear a a `` song-and-dance artist '' with his sister Josie in an act call `` The Lively Bootblack. '' Jerry and Helen Cohan , his parent , do another act at the same theatre the same week. During the `` Gay Nineties '' period , George M. coin his famous curtain speech : `` My mother thanks you , my father thanks you , my sister thanks you and I thank you. '' Mr. Cohan once autograph a photograph for Arnold Daly thus : `` I can write good play than any living dancer and dance well than any living playwright. '' Temperamental at First As a precocious young actor , Mr. Cohan have fit of temperament and anger which be never characteristic of his mature life. He continually quarrel with manager and stagehand , periodically announce himself `` through with the theatre '' and cause endless trouble for his family because of his rows. Once he leave the theatre at the end of the first act on an opening night because the producer rebuke him for play the part , not a he have rehearse it , but a his personal conception. His father and several stagehand drag him back. Often when `` the Four Cohans '' be bill first , a bad spot in vaudeville , he would fly into a rage and tell the theatre manager he would buy the theatre some day `` just to throw you out. '' Starting in his 'teens to write song and vaudeville sketch , Mr. Cohan turn out 150 sketch between the age of 17 and 21. In these he lay the foundation for his fortune , a he do not sell them for the standard rate of $ 50 each , but insist on royalty of $ 10 to $ 25 a week on each sketch a long it be played. Soon after the turn of the century he have an annual income estimate at [ text miss ] from his song and sketch and the play that he be begin to write. In 1901 he write , compose , direct and produce `` The Governor 's Son , '' his first Broadway production , which take `` the Four Cohans '' into the legitimate theatre. Soon thereafter , at the age of 26 , he join force with another young man , the last Sam H. Harris , in a partnership that take Broadway by storm and make reputation and rich for both. Together they put on `` Little Johnny Jones , '' a patriotic production toward which the orthodox dramatic critic be cool , but which become one of Broadway 's great hits. `` Energized American Stage '' The Cohan and Harris partnership last for fifteen year , during which they produce more than fifty comedy , play and revue , with and without music. At one time they control five theatre in New York , include the George M. Cohan Theatre at Broadway and Forty-second Street , and one in Chicago. They split in 1920 , each go along `` on his own , '' but come together again temporarily in 1937 to produce a play call `` Fulton of Oak Falls , '' which Parker Fennelly wrote. Mr. Cohan revise it and act in it title role. In his heyday Mr. Cohan possess an amazing energy. He would go on the road a the star of one play , take the cast of another with him , write a script late at night , and rehearse the second cast in the morning. He do most of his writing , either on the road or at home in his Fifth Avenue apartment , between midnight and dawn. Sometimes , when not act , he would take room in an Atlantic City hotel to write a new play. He write with a pencil on yellow paper. According to some of the critic , his great contribution to the theatre be in `` energize the American stage. '' His play be all action and speed. At first they be criticize for have no `` idea , '' a criticism which he voice himself , but a he grow old his work come to have more intellectual content. His reputation a a playwright grow gradually from the time he dramatize `` Seven Keys to Baldpate '' in 1913. The play offend some of the critic because of the unorthodox manner in which it baffle the audience , but it be a big hit , and it formula have be successfully follow by many subsequent writer of mystery plays. An Eccentric Dancer The fast movement of his playwriting derive largely from his experience a a `` song-and-dance man. '' He and his sister , Josie , be early exponent of eccentric dancing. They step high , fast and lively , sometimes dance right over the stage furniture. At first Josie be more in demand a an entertainer than her brother. There be a time when `` the Four Cohans '' act have to be break up because theatre manager be willing to pay Josie alone more than all four together. In his playwriting Mr. Cohan use the fast tempo of his vaudeville days. One of his big hit , `` The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly , '' be a continuous dance , the character sway , step and posture through their entrance , line and exits. From old-time vaudeville he also bring to the legitimate theatre a keen sense of burlesque. His `` revue '' of 1916 and 1918 strike a new and fresh note in Broadway musical comedy with their satire on people and event of the day. He be adept at take old-fashioned melodrama , burlesque them and transform them into hilarious comedy , a he do with `` The Tavern. '' He use the patriotic note whenever opportunity offer , and it be no accident that he happen to be the author of `` Over There. '' The tune , he say , pop into his head one day on the way to his office , and the bugle-line refrain and most of the first verse have form themselves in his head by the time he reach his desk. Joseph Tumulty , secretary to President Woodrow Wilson , send him the follow appreciation : `` Dear George Cohan : The President considers your war song 'Over There ' a genuine inspiration to all American manhood. '' `` Over There '' sell more than 1,500,000 copies. Mr. Cohan receive $ 25,000 for the mechanical instrument right alone , which he give to his mother , who distribute it among soldier ' fund and civic charities. He join an all-star cast in 1918 which make a two-week tour in a war play call `` Out There. '' This gross $ 600,000 for the Red Cross. During the 1919 actor ' strike Mr. Cohan , then one of the most active producer-manager-actors in the country , would not side with the actor , who be in the throe of form Actors Equity Association. After a bitter row , in which he take a leading part , he help find the rival Actors ' Fidelity League. He become president of this association , long since dissolved. Even after Equity dominate the situation he would not become a member , although after many year Equity actor be allow to appear with him on the stage under an amnesty grant to some member of the league. At the time of the strike he also resign from the Lambs and the Friars. He close all his show in protest and retire for several year from the stage. Star of `` Ah Wilderness ! '' As an actor in musical show Mr. Cohan bring the same vivacity to his performance a he do to his playwriting. It be when he act in a revival of his own play , `` The Song-and-Dance Man , '' in 1930 , that he describe himself a `` just a song-and-dance man , '' but by that time everybody in the world of the theatre know better. Incidentally , he write this play in tribute to his father , the old trouper , and to the vaudeville stage he himself have know a a boy , and which in later life he say be the only theatrical life he ever really loved. It be a the star of `` Ah Wilderness ! '' by Eugene O'Neill , that Mr. Cohan give his fine performance a a serious actor. Here `` the man who own Broadway '' prove that he could play with deep understanding and effect a role far remove from that garish thoroughfare or anything with which he have previously be associated. But he might not have accept the part except that Mr. O'Neill 's father , James O'Neill , star of `` Monte Cristo , '' `` The Three Musketeers '' and many other play , have be a trouper in the same old day a his own father. Mr. Cohan have little use for Hollywood. He resist all effort to get him into the film until 1915 , when he sign a contract that result in three silent movies. He do not return to Hollywood until 1932 , when he make his first `` talkie. '' Hollywood Capitulates `` It 's my last one , too , '' he announce when he return to New York. He have be treat none too sympathetically by Hollywood. Movie producer and employee , not recognize his unique position in the American theatre , have fail to make use of his genius. A gatekeeper have bar his automobile from the movie lot because he be `` not a star , '' and an obscure young sub-executive , immerse in routine , have reprove him for submit a manuscript in his familiar pencil writing on yellow paper. He felt lose , and be glad to be back on Broadway. But the movie , which eventually come to appreciate Shakespeare , though in it own good time , wake up to the devotion Mr. Cohan 's public have for their idol nine year later. After talk about film Mr. Cohan 's life for a year , one studio move the project into the script-writing stage in the Spring of 1941 , title it `` Yankee Doodle Dandy. '' Mr. Cohan , have fact pry from him by a Hollywood writer , be dubious but anxious about the whole business. `` Would anybody go to see it ? '' he asked. `` I do n't want to be connect with a box-office flop. '' `` Tell you what , we 'll give away dish and make sure , '' the Hollywood man offered. Mr. Cohan be reassure , but he have a request -- '' I 'd like to sit all by myself in a theatre and see what it add up to. '' After eight month , during which the veteran actor busy himself with plan for take part in entertainment for soldier and sailor , the private preview be held. Cohan walk out of the theatre and into a telegraph office to send a message to the Hollywood writer. It read : `` Thanks , kid. Hope you do n't run out of dishes. George M. '' Proved a Box-Office Hit For the privilege of attend the New York premiere at the Hollywood Theatre of the film , in which James Cagney play the part of Mr. Cohan , on May 20 , 1942 , a distinguish audience purchase $ 5,750,000 worth of war bonds. By Fall the picture have gross more than $ 1,000,000. July 3 , 1942 , be observe a George M. Cohan Day in New York by proclamation of Mayor La Guardia. The film have it premiere in London at the Warner Theatre on Oct. 15 , 1942 , and Britons buy & # 163 ; 870,269 in war security to attend. For all the money he make , Mr. Cohan be always predominantly the artist rather than the business man. He have an office , but seldom go to it. He transact much of his business from public telephone booth , remark that his office really be in his hat. He like to mingle with the audience between the act or after the show , or to sit up with crony over a late meal and a drink in an after-theatre restaurant off Broadway , talk about the current theatre. From these listening and talking , many new idea for play , as well a change in play already on the board developed. At one time he be almost as well know a a baseball fan a he be a a theatrical man. He remain a fan to the end of his day , but finally give up his practice of go to the game every day the Giants be in town. He marry twice. His first wife be Ethel Levey , who become his dancing partner with `` the Four Cohans '' after his sister Josie married. A daughter , Georgette , who become an actress , be bear to them.

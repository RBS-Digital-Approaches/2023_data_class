October 16 , 1964 OBITUARY Cole Porter Is Dead ; Songwriter Was 72 By The Associated Press SANTA MONICA , Calif. , Oct. 15 -- Cole Porter , the world-famed composer and lyricist , die at 11:05 P.M. today at a Santa Monica hospital , where he undergo kidney surgery last Tuesday. He be 72 year old. Mr. Porter write the lyric and music for his song , and to both he bring such an individuality of style that a genre know a `` the Cole Porter song '' become recognized. The hallmark of a typical Porter song be lyric that be urbane or witty and a melody with a sinuous , brood quality. Some of his best-known song in this vein be `` What Is This Thing Called Love , '' `` Night and Day , '' `` Love for Sale '' and `` Begin the Beguine. '' But an equally typical and equally recognizable Porter song would have a simple , bouncy melody and a lyric base on a long and entertaining list of similarity , opposite or contrasts. `` Let's Do It '' tick off the amiable amatory habit of bird , flower , crustacea , fish , insect , animal and various type of human , while `` You 're the Top '' be an exercise in the creation of superlative that include such item a `` the nimble tread of the foot of Fred Astaire , '' `` Garbo 's salary '' and `` Mickey Mouse. '' Still a third type of Porter song be exclamatory in both lyric and melody. `` Just One of Those Things , '' `` From This Moment On '' and `` It 's All Right With Me '' be instances. Reflected His Living The glossy opulence of the score Mr. Porter write for Broadway and Hollywood be a valid reflection of his own manner of living. Between World Wars he and his wife , the former Linda Lee of Louisville , Ky. , be active in a gay international set that gather at Paris , the Riviera and Venice. Their home on the Left Bank in Paris have platinum wallpaper and chair upholster in zebra skin. Mr. Porter once hire the entire Monte Carlo Ballet to entertain his house guests. For a party in Venice , where he rent the Palazzo Rezzonico for $ 4,000 a month , he hire 50 gondolier to act a footman and have a troupe of high-rope walker perform in a blaze of lights. Most of Mr. Porter 's song be write far from Broadway. His score for `` Anything Goes , '' which include `` I Get a Kick Out of You , '' `` You 're the Top , '' `` All Through the Night '' and the title song , be compose while he be cruise down the Rhine. He write the song for `` Jubilee '' ( `` Begin the Beguine , '' `` Just One of Those Things '' and `` Why Should n't I ? '' among others ) during a round-the- world cruise with the show 's librettist , Moss Hart. But Mr. Porter be no dilettante composer. Not even the rigor of his busy social round interfere with his creativity. `` I 've do lot of work at dinner , sit between two bore , '' he once said. `` I can feign listen beautifully. I can work anywhere. '' Praised by Rodgers He be a careful craftsman whose work win the admiration of his peers. Richard Rodgers have say , `` Few people realize how architecturally excellent his music is. There 's a foundation , a structure and an embellishment. Then you add the emotion he 's put in and the result be Cole Porter. '' Mr. Porter himself could not characterize his songs. `` I do n't know how my music get that way , '' he say when he be ask to make the effort. `` I simply ca n't analyze it. I can analyze the music of others. The word for Dick Rodgers 's melody , I think , be holy. For Jerome Kern , sentimental. For Irving Berlin , simplicity. For my own , I do n't know. '' Mr. Porter be a trim , slight , dark man , groom in subdue , elegant taste. He usually sport a boutonniere in the lapel of his well-tailored suits. His speech be quiet , reserve , almost clipped. He be bear on a 750-acre farm in Peru , Ind. , on June 9 , 1892 , the son of Samuel Fenwick Porter , a fruit grower , and the former Kate Cole. He could play the violin when he be 6 and the piano when he be 8. At the age of 10 he compose a song , `` The Bobolink Waltz , '' that please his mother so much that she have it publish in Chicago. Despite the boy 's musical leaning , his maternal grandfather , J. O. Cole , who have make a fortune in the lumber business , want him to be a lawyer. To this ostensible end , young Porter be send to Worcester Academy in Massachusetts and to Yale , where he write two of the most famous of all college song , `` Bingo Eli Yale '' and the `` Yale Bulldog Song. '' He continue his study at the Harvard Law School but , at the suggestion of the dean , transfer to the School of Music. With a fellow student , T. Lawrason Riggs , he write a show , `` See America First , '' which be produce on Broadway in 1916 with a cast that include Clifton Webb. It be a failure. Mr. Porter then join the French Foreign Legion where he have a specially construct portable piano make for him so that he could carry it on his back and entertain the troop in their bivouacs. In 1919 he marry Mrs. Linda Lee Thomas , widow of E. R. Thomas , a banker and publisher , and settle in Paris. Mr. Porter make casual contribution to two revue during the early 1920 's , `` Hitchy-Koo '' and `` Greenwich Village Follies of 1924 , '' but he be not induce to write a Broadway score again until 1928 , where he contribute the song to `` Paris , '' a play with incidental music that star Irene Bordoni. Only five of Mr. Porter 's song be use in the final production , but one be the provocatively amuse `` Let 's Do It. '' During the intervening year he have be write and perform song for the amusement of his friend , but the reception accord `` Let 's Do It '' apparently convince him that he could communicate pleasurably to a broad audience.

He be 77. The cause of death be colon cancer , say Paige Braddock , creative director for Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates. Mr. Schulz draw `` Peanuts '' for nearly half a century. He swear that no one else would ever draw the comic strip and he keep his word. For year he draw `` Peanuts '' with a hand tremor. He finally put down his pen when he receive a diagnosis of colon cancer after abdominal surgery in November. His last daily strip run on Jan. 3.

'' His wife , Jeannie , say , `` He have do everything he wanted. '' Lynn Johnston , a friend of Mr. Schulz and the creator of `` For Better or for Worse , '' tell The Associated Press , `` It 's amazing that he die just before his last strip be published. '' Such an end , she say , be `` a if he have write it that way. '' She recall something Mr. Schulz tell her a she sit in the hospital with him last year : `` You control all these character and the life they live. You decide when they get up in the morning , when they 're go to fight with their friend , when they 're go to lose the game. Is n't it amaze how you have no control over your real life ? '' But , Ms. Johnston say , `` I think , in a way , he did. '' The life of `` Peanuts '' and Charles Schulz be completely intertwined. `` The strip and he be one , '' say Patrick McDonnell , who draw the cartoon `` Mutts. '' `` He put his heart and soul into that strip. '' `` Peanuts , '' which reach reader in 75 country , 2,600 paper and 21 language every day , make Mr. Schulz very rich. The `` Peanuts '' strip , merchandise and product endorsement bring in $ 1.1 billion a year. And Mr. Schulz be say to have earn about $ 30 million to $ 40 million annually. His saga of Charlie Brown , Snoopy , Lucy and Linus `` be arguably the long story ever tell by one human be , '' Robert Thompson , a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University , observe on the PBS `` NewsHour '' with Jim Lehrer , long than any epic poem , any Tolstoy novel , any Wagner opera. In all Mr. Schulz draw more than 18,250 strip in nearly 50 years. Jules Feiffer , the cartoonist and playwright , say that the `` Peanuts '' character endure because they be the first real child in the comic page , one with doubt and anxieties. And there be a lot of them. `` Linus , Lucy , Charlie Brown -- these interesting little people form a repertory company , '' he said. A Long-Running Ensemble Act The cast of `` Peanuts '' change remarkably little. It include Charlie Brown , a wishy-washy boy with a tree-loving kite and a lose baseball team ; Snoopy , an unflappable beagle with a fancy inner life ; Lucy , a fussbudget with a football and a curbside psychiatric clinic ; Linus , a philosophical blanket-carrier ; Sally , Charlie Brown 's romantic little sister ; Schroeder , a virtuoso on the toy piano and a Beethoven devotee ; Peppermint Patty , a narcoleptic D-minus student ; and , in late year , Woodstock , a small , expressive but speechless bird. Mr. Schulz remember wake up in the night many year ago and thinking , `` Good grief , who be all these little people ? Must I live with them for the rest of my life ? '' The answer be yes. Charles Monroe Schulz , the son of Carl Schulz , a barber , like Charlie Brown 's father , and the former Dena Halverson , be bear in Minneapolis on Nov. 26 , 1922. Young Charles be nickname Sparky after the horse Spark Plug in the comic strip `` Barney Google. '' He have a black-and-white dog name Spike ( memorialize in the character of Snoopy 's skinny Western brother ) . He want to be a cartoonist a a child and practice by draw Popeye. `` Someday , Charles , you 're go to be an artist , '' a kindergarten teacher tell him after look at his drawing of a man shovel snow. His ambition be to do a comic strip as good a George Herriman 's `` Krazy Kat , '' but Mr. Schulz also admire Picasso , Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. Snoopy keep a van Gogh and a Wyeth in his doghouse. The hurt of Mr. Schulz 's early year provide a lifetime of material. At Central High School in St. Paul , he flunk Latin , English , algebra and physics. `` Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! '' accept one of his drawing when he be 15 -- a picture of Spike illustrate `` a hunting dog that eat pin , tack and razor blade '' -- but the cartoon he draw for his high school yearbook be rejected. Mr. Schulz remember his failure more vividly than his successes. After his high school graduation he take a correspondence course from Art Instruction Inc. , but before he could start a career he be draft into the Army. He leave for boot camp only day after his mother die of cancer. ( Mr. Schulz later suggest that this coincidence might have be the reason for his lifelong hatred of travel. ) During World War II , from 1943 to 1945 , Mr. Schulz serve in France and Germany and become a staff sergeant in the 20th Armored Division. He once refuse to toss a grenade into an artillery emplacement because he saw a little dog wander into it. After the war he try various odd job : letter the comic at a Catholic magazine call Timeless Topix ; draw a weekly cartoon call `` Li'l Folks , '' the precursor to `` Peanuts , '' for the St. Paul Pioneer Press ; and sell occasional spot cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post. He also teach at Art Instruction Inc. There he fell in love with a redhead , Donna Johnson , and propose marriage. She turn him down and marry a fireman instead. He never forgot. Ms. Johnson become the Little Red-Haired Girl , Charlie Brown 's unrequited love , who be often talk about but never see in the strip. Mr. Schulz marry Joyce Halverson in 1949 ; the marriage end in divorce. `` You ca n't create humor out of happiness , '' Mr. Schulz say in his 1980 book , `` Charlie Brown , Snoopy and Me. '' `` I 'm astonish at the number of people who write to me say , 'Why ca n't you create happy story for u ? Why do Charlie Brown always have to lose ? Why ca n't you let him kick the football ? ' Well , there be nothing funny about the person who get to kick the football. '' The strip 's start be bittersweet. In 1949 Mr. Schulz submit some of his `` Li'l Folks '' comic strip to United Feature Syndicate. The syndicate like the strip but insist on call it `` Peanuts '' because `` Li'l Folks '' be too similar to the name of another strip. `` I be very upset with the title , '' Mr. Schulz once say , `` and still am. '' On Oct. 2 , 1950 , the first `` Peanuts '' strip be published. It depict two child sit on the sidewalk discuss Charlie Brown : `` Well , here come ol ' Charlie Brown ! '' . . . `` Good ol' Charlie Brown '' . . . `` Yes , sir ! Good ol ' Charlie Brown. '' And then , a Charlie Brown pass them , `` How I hate him ! '' That year seven newspaper buy `` Peanuts , '' and Mr. Schulz earn $ 90 a week in royalties. But by 1953 the cartoon be a hit and he be earn $ 30,000 a year. In 1955 ( and again in 1964 ) the National Cartoonists Society award Mr. Schulz the Reuben for be the outstanding cartoonist of the year. He receive the Yale Humor Award in 1956 and the School Bell Award from the National Education Association in 1960. Unrequited Love With Roots in Real Life `` Peanuts '' be base on repetition and predictability. As Mr. Schulz put it , `` All the love in the strip be unrequited ; all the baseball game be lose ; all the test score be D-minuses ; the Great Pumpkin never come ; and the football be always pull away. '' One of the few innovation Mr. Schulz introduce be allow Snoopy ( after eight year ) to stand on two foot and to have his thought write out in balloons. Snoopy could always be count on to nap , fantasize and wonder when his next meal would arrive. Charlie Brown , the round-headed blockhead ( name after one of Mr. Schulz 's childhood friend , not after the cartoonist himself ) , could always be count on to persevere despite constant failure. He once hold onto the string of a kite that be stick in a tree for eight day run , until the rain make him stop. At the time it be the long run of immobility for any cartoon character. His first home run come after nearly 43 year of strike out , on March 30 , 1993. No adult ever appear in `` Peanuts , '' though in television special there be occasional wah-wah sound denote the voice of teacher and parents. As Mr. Schulz once put it , `` Well , there just be n't room for them. '' Curses never get bad than `` Aaugh ! '' `` Good grief , '' `` Rats ! '' `` Curse you , Red Baron ! '' or a knot of line scrunch up in frustration. The strip be just the beginning. In 1952 Mr. Schulz start turn out `` Peanuts '' book : `` Peanuts , '' `` More Peanuts , '' `` Good Grief , More Peanuts ! '' `` Good Ol ' Charlie Brown , '' `` Happiness Is a Warm Puppy '' and dozen more. New compilation roll off the press every year for decades. Eventually `` Peanuts '' be translate into Serbo-Croatian , Malay , Chinese , Tlingit , Catalan and 15 other languages. Books come out with title like , `` Het Grote Snoopy Winterspelletjes-Boek '' and `` Du Bist Sub , Charlie Braun. '' The 1960 's bring animate `` Peanuts '' television specials. The first be `` A Charlie Brown Christmas , '' which Mr. Schulz write in one weekend with Lee Mendelson. Accompanied by Vince Guaraldi 's jazz piano , animate by Bill Melendez and unassisted by any laugh track , `` A Charlie Brown Christmas '' be show on CBS in 1965 ( and still run every winter ) . It win an Emmy and a Peabody. Many more television special follow , include `` It 's the Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown. '' Five of the special win Emmys. There be also `` Peanuts '' feature film , include `` A Boy Named Charlie Brown. '' The takeoff come roll in. In 1966 the Royal Guardsmen write a rock song , `` Snoopy and the Red Baron. '' In 1967 a musical , `` You 're a Good Man , Charlie Brown , '' be produce Off Broadway. ( A 1999 revival on Broadway win two Tony Awards. ) `` Peanuts Gallery , '' a concerto , be compose by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and have it premiere at Carnegie Hall in 1997. Mr. Schulz receive the Ordre de Arts et de Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture. In 1990 his work be show at the Louvre ; the gala have Snoopys in couture. Many pundit try to put their finger on the `` Peanuts '' spell and they generally ramble on in a vaguely philosophical vein. Umberto Eco , who write the introduction to the first Italian `` Peanuts '' book , refer to Mr. Schulz 's work a `` poesie interrompue , '' or interrupted poetry , and , use Freud , Beckett , Adler and Thomas Mann to back him up , say , `` These child affect u because in a certain sense they be monster ; they be the monstrous infantile reduction of all the neurosis of a modern citizen of the industrial civilization. '' In an essay call `` Peanuts : The Americanization of Augustine , '' Arthur Asa Berger , a scholar of popular culture , observe that Mr. Schulz be `` a mirthful moralist '' and a master of Freudian humor , humor that `` serf to mask aggression. '' Mr. Berger call Snoopy `` an existential hero in every sense of the term , '' a dog who `` strives , with dog persistence and unyielding courage , to overcome what seem to be his fate -- that he be a dog. '' He be `` a bon vivant , he participate in history , he have an incredible imagination , he be witty , he express himself with virtuosity in any number of way ( eye movement , ear movement , tail movement , wisecrack , facial expression ) and he be superb a mimic and dancer. '' The most concerted attempt to bring `` Peanuts '' to heel philosophically come in the 1960 's when Robert L. Short , a minister , write two book on `` Peanuts '' theology , `` The Gospel According to Peanuts '' ( 1964 ) and `` The Parables of Peanuts '' ( 1968 ) . The Rev. Short saw sign of original sin in the `` Peanuts '' child , who be unable `` to produce any radical change for the good in themselves -- or in each other. '' He saw `` the hazard of worship deity '' demonstrate in Linus 's belief in the Great Pumpkin. And he call Snoopy `` a typical Christian , '' a flawed character who be nonetheless good : `` He be lazy , he be a 'chow hound ' without parallel , he be bitingly sarcastic , he be frequently a coward , '' Mr. Short wrote. But he be `` a hound of heaven. '' If the `` Peanuts '' character leave themselves open to the maunderings of philosopher , minister and analyst , they be even more vulnerable to toy , card , book and clothing manufacturers. The licensing madness begin in 1958 when the first plastic Snoopy and Charlie Brown come out. In 1960 Hallmark begin print `` Peanuts '' card and party goods. Then come sweatshirt and pajama , thermos and lunch boxes. Plush Snoopy come in 1965. Woodstock slipper , Lucy picture frame , Charlie Brown music box followed. Mr. Schulz vet all product for appropriateness and reject some : baby wipe for aesthetic reason , ashtray , vitamin , sugary breakfast cereal , ice skate and tennis rackets. There be commercial too. In 1957 the `` Peanuts '' character start sell Ford Falcons. For 15 year they work for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Snoopy be the official mascot of NASA , and in 1969 NASA 's lunar excursion module on the Apollo 11 mission be call Snoopy. The command module be Charlie Brown. A Menagerie Of Merchandising By 1999 there be 20,000 different new product each year adorn by `` Peanuts '' characters. In 1994 Mr. Schulz be induct into the Licensing Industry Merchandisers ' Association Hall of Fame. Jim Davis , the creator of the cartoon `` Garfield , '' who be no stranger to commercialization , say , `` Schulz create the industry as far a cartooning and licensing go. '' When ask whether he mind his character sell merchandise , Mr. Schulz say , `` I do n't think there 's such a thing a go commercial with a comic strip because a comic strip be a commercial right from the beginning. '' It be there to sell newspaper , he said. In 1989 Forbes list the cartoonist among the ten wealthy entertainer , earn $ 32 million a year. Nonetheless his lifestyle remain simple. Mr. Schulz , who hat to travel , say he would have be happy live his whole life in Minneapolis. But `` I have a restless first wife , '' so they move to Sebastopol , Calif. , and he set up his studio in Santa Rosa. In 1969 , after the local ice rink close , he and his wife , Joyce , build a new one , the Redwood Empire Ice Skating Arena. `` Because of Snoopy 's hockey playing , '' Mr. Schulz explain , `` I have to keep in the game. So I buy an arena. '' Charles and Joyce Schulz have five child , but the marriage end in divorce in 1972. He say , `` I do n't think she like me anymore , and I just get up and leave one day. '' A year later he meet Jeannie Clyde at the ice rink and marry her. Mr. Schulz 's workday typically begin with a trip in his Mercedes ( license plate WDSTK1 , after Woodstock ) down from the hill near where he live , breakfast at the ice rink 's Warm Puppy Snack Bar , a trip to his stone-and-redwood studio at One Snoopy Place to draw his strip , lunch at the ice rink , more work in the afternoon in his studio and dinner at a restaurant with his wife. While his small staff dealt with the commercial end of the business , he attend only to drawing. He use a yellow legal pad for sketch and draw with an Esterbrook Radial pen. He would start doodle until something funny happened. He never take suggestion from anyone ( though he do draw on conversation , newspaper , Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations , and his child 's antics. `` Drawing a daily comic strip be not unlike have an English theme hang over your head every day for the rest of your life , '' he once said. He could do a strip an hour and six strip a day , but prefer not to. He generally keep three month ahead of publication and never take more than ten day off at a time , and then only reluctantly. `` Peanuts '' continue to appear when Mr. Schulz have quadruple-bypass heart surgery in 1981. And it be only under order from United Feature that he take off for five week in 1997 for his 75th birthday. Jeannie Schulz once say that all the character in `` Peanuts '' be part of her husband. `` He 's crabby like Lucy , diffident like Charlie Brown. There 's a lot of Linus -- he 's philosophical and wonder about life. '' Like Schroeder , he love classical music , though he prefer Brahms to Beethoven. And like Snoopy , he be a war buff. Snoopy have all of World War I covered. But Mr. Schulz know all the World War II battleground and be the head of a capital fund-raising campaign for the National D-Day Memorial. He be a member of the Church of God , where he be a Sunday school teacher and administrator and would occasionally deliver the Sunday sermon. People describe Mr. Schulz a look like a druggist. He find Garry Trudeau 's `` Doonesbury '' and Walt Kelly 's `` Pogo '' too political , but he admire the work of Cathy Guisewite , the cartoonist who draw `` Cathy , '' and Ms. Johnston , of `` For Better or for Worse. '' His favorite ice cream flavor be vanilla. Mr. Schulz be survive by his wife , a philanthropist , and his child : Meredith Hodges , who raise mule in Loveland , Colo. ; Charles Jr. ( call Monte ) , a novelist in Nevada City , Calif. ; Craig , a private pilot in Santa Rosa ; Amy Johnson , a homemaker with nine child in Alpine , Utah ; and Jill Schulz Transki , who run an in-line skating business with her husband in Santa Barbara , Calif.

Personal Anxieties Shared With Millions Despite his large family and large success he be a melancholy man who worry and be often lonely , depress and plague by panic attack , feature that Rheta Grimsley Johnson bring out in her 1989 biography `` Good Grief : The Story of Charles M. Schulz. '' Sally , Charlie Brown 's sister , put it well in a school report on night and day : `` Daytime be so you can see where you 're going. Nighttime be so you can lie in bed worrying. '' Mr. Schulz have a white terrier name Andy , play golf ( 12 handicap ) , tennis ( for a while with Billie Jean King ) and bridge. But he be most devote to hockey and ice skating. He be a right-handed shot. He hat cat , coconut and sleep away from home. And he never forget a slight. Ms. Johnston once say , `` He 's bitter about the little red-haired girl who do n't marry him , he 's bitter about his divorce , he 's bitter about get old. '' And he be bitter about the lack of recognition cartoonist get. This be what he say about cartooning : `` It will destroy you. It will break your heart. '' The creator of one of the least troubled dog of all time , Mr. Schulz compare his own panic to that of a dog `` run frantically down the road pursue the family car. '' The dog `` be not really be leave behind , '' he say , `` but for that moment in his limited understanding , he be be leave alone forever. '' As Mr. Schulz get old he begin to think about the end of his strip. His hand quaver , but he know that he do not want anyone else to draw the cartoon. `` Everything have to end , '' he once said. `` This be my excuse for existence. No one else will touch it. '' In November he be hospitalize for colon cancer and start chemotherapy. On Dec. 14 he announce that his strip would end. But thought of death have long since seep into his strip. `` After you 've die , do you get to come back ? '' Linus once ask Charlie Brown. He reply , `` If they stamp your hand. '' Mr. Schulz always felt for the little man and the little animal. He once say that his philosophy of life could be find in the Gospel of St. Luke : `` It be good for him that a millstone be hang about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones.

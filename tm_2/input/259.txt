December 31 , 1979 OBITUARY Richard Rodgers Is Dead at Age 77 ; Broadway 's Renowned Composer By Alden Whitman Richard Rodgers , the world renowned composer and lyricist , die at his East Side home in Manhattan at 10:28 P.M. last night after a long illness. He be 77 year old. A spokesman for the family say funeral service would be private. `` The Garrick Gaieties , '' `` A Connecticut Yankee , '' `` Babes in Arms , '' `` The Boys From Syracuse , '' `` Pal Joey , '' `` Oklahoma ! '' `` Carousel , '' `` South Pacific , '' `` Flower Drum Song , '' `` The King and I , '' `` The Sound of Music. '' What bind together these disparate musical comedy be a single phrase span 55 year of Broadway : `` Music by Richard Rodgers. '' The phrase connote the seemingly endless flow of wonderfully singable , danceable melody that pour out of Mr. Rodgers. And couple with the name of his two principal lyricist , Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein 2d , the phrase also symbolize the evolution of American musical comedy into an art form of stature , in which plot , music and dancing be closely integrated and frequently employ to explore serious , even tragic , themes. Remarkably , too , `` Music by Richard Rodgers , '' which be totally professional and businesslike , climb virtually uninterrupted from triumph to triumph for decades. It be the stuff of which legend be nurtured. These success bring Mr. Rodgers , his musical and film a cascade of award , prize and honorary degrees. `` Oklahoma ! '' win a special Pulitzer Prize in 1944 and `` South Pacific '' earn the Pulitzer Drama Prize in 1950. That musical also gain Mr. Rodgers an Antoinette Perry Award , one of seven `` Tony '' award give to him ; and the music for `` Carousel '' receive the Donaldson Award. Moreover , he win an Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1946 for `` It Might a Sell Be Spring , '' from `` State Fair. '' Last year , he be honor by President Carter at a White House reception and , with Marian Anderson , Fred Astaire , George Balanchine and Arthur Rubinstein , be among the first recipient of the annual Kennedy Center Honors. Last June , at the `` Tony '' Awards ceremony , he receive the Lawrence Langner Award for a `` lifetime of distinguished achievement in the American theater. '' The Rodgers career span more than 60 year and unfold in three phrase -- his collaboration with Mr. Hart from 1918 until shortly before Mr. Hart 's death in 1943 ; his collaboration with Mr. Hammerstein from 1942 until Mr. Hammerstein 's death in 1960 , and his less notable collaboration after 1960. Compares Collaborators Mr. Rodgers , in an interview some year ago , cite some of the distinction between his two principal collaborators. `` Larry be much gayer and light than Oscar , '' he said. `` He be incline to be cynical , where Oscar never was. Oscar be more sentimental and so the music have to be more sentimental. It would n't have be natural for Larry to write 'Oklahoma ! ' any more than it would have be natural for Oscar to write 'Pal Joey. ' '' Though his work with Mr. Hart and Mr. Hammerstein be highly successful , his contribution to the growth of musical comedy be particularly mark in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership. Unlike many musical of the 1920 's and 1930 's , which sandwich thin and improbable story between pretty girl and burst of singing , the Rodgers and Hammerstein show strive to offer full-dimensioned human being a the principal character and to project somewhat probable plots. Beautiful girl remain , of course , but instead of kick in chorus line , they perform dance intricate enough to be choreograph into ballets. The composer strike off the formidable total of 1,500 song , at least 85 of them regard a `` standard , '' or popular classic , in the music publishing industry. They range from `` Manhattan , '' the hit from `` The Garrick Gaieties '' of 1925 , to the tune of his last Broadway show , the musical version of `` I Remember Mama , '' which open last summer. 42 Musicals on Broadway His best song - those that generation hum , sang and dance to - include these : `` The Blue Room , '' `` Mountain Greenery , '' `` My Heart Stood Still , '' `` With a Song in My Heart , '' `` There 's a Small Hotel , '' `` Funny Valentine , '' `` The Lady Is a Tramp , '' `` This Ca n't Be Love , '' `` Bewitched , Bothered and Bewildered , '' `` Oh , What a Beautiful Mornin ' , '' `` If I Loved You , '' `` June Is Bustin ' Out All Over , '' `` Bali Ha'i , '' `` I 'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy , '' `` Some Enchanted Evening , '' `` Getting to Know You , '' `` My Favorite Things , '' `` Climb Every Mountain , '' `` Is n't It Romantic , '' `` Easy to Remember , '' `` It Might as Well Be Spring '' and `` It 's a Grand Night for Singing. '' There be 42 Rodgers musical on Broadway over the year , and revival too numerous to mention. There be also a number of noted television series and special with his music in the background. Film version be make of 19 Rodgers musical , and dozen of the Broadway production have be revive over the year in theater across the county and throughout Europe , the Middle East , Africa and the Far East. At one point in 1975 , 60 production of `` Oklahoma ! '' be under way in the United States and abroad , and a critic declared : `` Probably not a day go by without a show of his be perform somewhere in the world. '' 'Pipeline to Heaven' Mr. Rodgers 's talent for write unforgettable melody astonish his friends. `` Dick 's get that pipeline to heaven that go through him , '' Allan Jay Lerner , the librettist , once said. Less astound be the composer himself , who remark a couple of year ago : `` I admit , with no modesty whatever , that not many people can do it. But when they say , 'You 're a genius , ' I say , 'No , it 's my job. ' '' To the untutored , Mr. Rodgers seem to be able to compose instantaneously , an impression that be create by story about how he write tune over breakfast ( he once do that ) and by Mr. Lerner 's account of telephone Mr. Rodgers with a suggested title of have him call back within five minute with a whole tune. `` I get no place try to tell people that story be n't true , '' Mr. Rodgers lamented. `` The song situation have probably be go around in my head for weeks. Sometimes it take months. I do n't believe that a writer do something wonderful spontaneously. I believe it 's the result of year of living , of study , reading , his very personality and temperament. At one particular moment all these come together and the artist 'expresses ' himself. '' Mr. Rodgers be sufficiently versatile , however , to write music before the lyric be fashion ( a he do with Mr. Hart ) , or oppositely ( a be his way with Mr. Hammerstein ) . In either event , he could compose at any hour , anywhere , with or without a piano. Collector of Art This be a gift that earn the composer well over $ 100 million , and he return much of it in kind to the arts. In 1970 , he build a $ 1 million recreation center and a 1,932-seat theater in Mount Morris Park in Harlem , where he grow up. Mr. Rodgers also establish scholarship at the Juilliard School of Music , the American Theater Wing and the American Academy of Dramatic Art , as well a a number of award for young composer , musician and other theater people. He give another $ 1 million last year for an endowment to finance production of new musical in New York. Some of his money go for a 14-room duplex apartment on Park Avenue and a country house in Southport , Conn. , for a handsome collection of modern sculpture and painting that include work by Matisse , Vlaminck , Dubuffet and Giacometti , and for a closet full of custom-tailored suit and shirt with which he drape his stocky frame. Indeed , Mr. Rodgers , with his dapperly brush dark gray hair , medium height , brown eye and round face , resemble a prosperous financier rather than a harried Broadway showman. A neat briefcase enhance his nontheatrical appearance. As the Rodgers legend grow over the year , his name become a household word. There be endless newspaper and magazine article about him and his work , in addition to several book , include an autobiography , `` Musical Stages , '' a 371-page volume publish by Random House in 1975. `` Rodgers & Hart , '' by Samuel Marx and Jan Clayton , appear in 1976. Studied Under Damrosch Richard Rodgers be bear of well-to-do parent , Dr. William Abraham Rodgers and Mamie Levy Rodgers , in New York on June 28 , 1902. Encouraged by his mother , an excellent pianist , and by his physician-father , who like to sing Broadway operetta at home , Richard learn to pick out tune with one finger on the piano when he be 4 year old. He compose his first song -- '' Auto Show Girl '' -- when he be 14 , his first musical comedy -- a Columbia student show -- at 17 , his first hit show -- The Garrick Gaieties '' -- when he be 23. Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hart meet in 1918. They like each other immediately , and quickly develop fondness and respect. `` Larry Hart , '' his partner recall , `` be a genius at lyric construction , at rhyming , at find the offbeat way of express himself. '' `` He have a somewhat sardonic view of the world that can be find occasionally in his love song and in his satirical numbers. But Larry be also a kind , gentle , generous little guy. Working with him , however , do present problem since he have to be literally trap into put pen to paper -- and then only after hear a melody that stimulate him , '' Mr. Rodgers said. Drawn by the flame of Broadway , Mr. Rodgers leave Columbia after his sophomore year to work with Mr. Hart. They have a middling success with `` Poor Little Ritz Girl '' in 1920 and then five year of dross , during which Mr. Rodgers study under Walter Damrosch and , with Mr. Hart , put on amateur production for school and synagogues. Finally , the two men write an amateur musical a a fund-raising show for the Theater Guild , from which emerge the guild 's `` The Garrick Gaieties '' in 1925. An immediate success , it run for 211 performances. It be follow by `` Dearest Enemy , '' and then in 1926 by four Broadway production -- '' The Girl Friend , '' the second `` Garrick Gaieties , '' `` Peggy-Ann '' and `` Betsy '' -- and one in London , `` Lido Lady. '' By the close of the decade the team have write `` A Connecticut Yankee , '' `` Present Arms , '' `` Spring Is Here '' and `` Heads Up. '' Although these be mark , a be all the musical Mr. Rodgers have a hand in , by a perfectionist 's attention to detail , they be short on plot. Changes in the 30's In the 30 's , however , significant change be observable. `` On Your Toes , '' stag in 1936 , integrate ballet into the plot ; and in `` Babes in Arms '' the following year each song be a `` plot '' song. In 1938 the Rodgers and Hart team turn to Shakespeare for `` The Boys From Syracuse , '' a first for musical comedy. Between show in the 30 's the team be recruit by Hollywood for eight film , few of them of great distinction. In fact , Mr. Rodgers say later that he would like to forget all his Hollywood score except those for `` Love Me Tonight '' and `` State Fair. '' In 1940 come the Rodgers and Hart `` Pal Joey , '' an engaging tale of the adventure of an admitted cad. It do well in it initial run and even good when it run for 18 month in a revival in 1952. Shortly after `` By Jupiter '' in 1942 , the Theater Guild ask Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hart to do a musical version of Lynn Rigg 's `` Green Grow the Lilacs. '' However , Mr. Hart be beset by illness ( he die in 1943 ) , and Mr. Rodgers seek out Mr. Hammerstein , a friend of many year , to collaborate on what become `` Oklahoma ! '' Partners Compared Compared to Mr. Hart , Mr. Hammerstein bring a wholly different personality to the collaborative effort. Mr. Rodgers once write : `` Oscar Hammerstein 's view of life be more positive , more optimistic. He have a wonderful family. He be a joiner , a leader , a man willing to do battle for whatever cause he believe in. . . . He be as meticulous a craftsman a Larry , and he be extremely versatile. As a partner , he be completely dependable. `` As far a his work with me be concern , Oscar always write about the thing that affect him deeply. What be truly remarkable be his never-ending ability to find new way of reveal how he felt about three interrelate theme -- nature , music and love. `` In 'Oh , What a Beautiful Mornin ' , '' the first song we write together for 'Oklahoma ! , ' Oscar describe an idyllic summer day on a farm when 'all the sound of the earth be like music. ' `` In 'It 's a Grand Night for Singing , ' he reveal that the thing most likely to induce people to sing be a warm , moonlit , starry night and the first thrill of fall in love. `` In 'You Are Never Away , ' he compare a girl with 'the song I sing , ' 'the rainbow I chase , ' 'a morning in spring ' and 'the star in the lace of a wild willow tree.' Praise for 'Oklahoma ! ' `` In 'Younger Than Springtime , ' another girl be 'warmer than the wind of June ' and 'sweeter than music. ' In our last collaboration , 'The Sound of Music , ' just about everything Oscar felt about nature and music and love be sum up in the title song. '' When `` Oklahoma ! '' open March 31 , 1943 , the critic discern a marvelous blend of well- integrated dialogue , lyric , music and dance drawn from native American source that tell a believable story. `` While the song fit the period of 1900 perfectly in mood and character , '' write Howard Barnes in The Herald Tribune , `` they be in no sense derivative. It be strictly a Rodgers score and an extraordinarily varied and beautiful one. '' Olin Downes , The New York Times music critic , find that `` the music be not folk music , but that of a Broadway composer writing in popular vein , free , skillfully and with taste , and a fortunate relinquishment of the jazzeries of previous fashion. '' The musical ran for five year -- 2,212 performances. In that period , two million copy of it sheet music be sell and more than 500,000 album of the cast recording. Its backer receive a 25-to-1 return on their investment. Revivals , and there be score of them , add to this figure. The late revival of `` Oklahoma ! '' open at the Palace Theater just a few week ago , on Dec. 13. Success of 'South Pacific' While the original `` Oklahoma ! '' be pack the St. James Theater , Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Hammerstein write `` Carousel '' in 1945 and `` Allegro '' in 1947. At the same time they enter the produce field with `` I Remember Mama '' in 1945 and follow with `` Annie Get Your Gun , '' for which Irving Berlin write the music and lyrics. Perhaps the great success of the Rodgers and Hammerstein combination be `` South Pacific , '' the first musical of their joint authorship that they themselves produce in association with Leland Hayward and Joshua Logan , who do some of the libretto. Opening at the Majestic Theater April 7 , 1949 , it run for 1,925 performance , while a national company tour the country for five years. In addition , it be make into a movie and revive innumerable times. It be still run on Broadway in 1952 when two other Rodgers show -- '' The King and I '' and a revival of `` Pal Joey '' -- be play in theater on the same block. In addition to `` The King and I , '' the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership provide two other gargantuan hit in the 1950 's -- '' Flower Drum Song '' in 1958 and `` The Sound of Music '' in 1959. In the period of his two collaboration , Mr. Rodgers also discover the time to compose 13 hour of music for `` Victory at Sea , '' a television show for the Navy ; the score for `` Winston Churchill -- The Valiant Years , '' also a television series ; a ballet ; and a nightclub revue. After Mr. Hammerstein 's death in 1960 , Mr. Rodgers try write his own lyric -- for `` No Strings '' in 1962 , with book by Samuel Taylor -- and work with other collaborator -- Stephen Sondheim for `` Do I Hear a Waltz ? '' in 1965 -- but without the grand success he have achieve in previous years. There be other Rodgers musical in the last decade , but none be major hit and some be rake by critic , though the Rodgers music be usually spar such treatment. `` Two By Two '' arrive to mixed review in 1970 , a production base on the Clifford Odets play retell the Genesis story of Noah and the Ark. It have lyric by Martin Charnin and Danny Kaye in the starring role. `` Rex , '' a musical about Henry VIII of England , get an icy reception from critic in 1974. It have lyric by Sheldon Harnick and a book by Sherman Yellen. There be Broadway revival of `` Pal Joey '' in 1976 and `` The King and I '' and `` The Sound of Music '' in 1977. And last summer , `` I Remember Mama , '' originally produce by the Rodgers and Hammerstein team a a straight play in 1945 , return to Broadway with music by Mr. Rodgers and word by Martin Charnin. In 1975 , a show call `` Rodgers & Hart , '' celebrate the great day of the team , pack 98 song into what one critic call `` a champagne fizz of an evening '' and `` sheer fun. '' Post at Lincoln Center In 1962 Mr. Rodgers be name president and produce director of the Music Theater of Lincoln Center , which have revive many musical at the New York State Theater , include , inevitably , the cream of Mr. Rodgers 's own works. He spend many of his business hour at Rodgers & Hammerstein , his office on Madison Avenue , which he furnish with painting by Larry Rivers , Adolph Gottlieb and Pierre Soulages , Directoire furniture , a modern couch , a Biedermeier table and an Empire chair. There be no desk , but a grand piano. Twelve year ago , when he be 65 , the American Society of Composer , Authors and Publishers give him a luncheon on the stage of the Alvin Theater. In the evening , Mayor Lindsay present the Handel Medallion , the city 's high cultural award , to him at a reception at Gracie Mansion. The reception draw most of Broadway , include Diahann Carroll , Alfred Drake , Martha Lright , Ray Heatherton , Dorothy Sarnoff , Kitty Carlisle and George Abbott. Mr. Rodgers be indomitable about his work. Not even an operation for cancer of the jaw in 1955 keep him away from the theater for any length of time , though he spend three month in the hospital in 1956 for a rest cure. His voice be somewhat hoarse , the result of a laryngectomy in 1974. Apart from an occasional game of croquet , his only known diversion be listen by the hour to his own songs. `` Each become a hobby of it own for me , '' he once remarked. `` I hear a very interesting definition of work from a lawyer. Work , he say , be any activity you 'd rather not do. `` I go to the theater and I rehearse word , music , book and so on with people who be -- at least superficially -- very agreeable and very attractive. Then people tell me. 'You 're work hard. ' `` I have to laugh to myself. I do n't find it work to write music , because I enjoy it. I 'd find an evening of bridge hard work , because you have to think like hell and at the end you get nothing for it. `` There be n't anything I want to do , that I haven't. At the same time , there be n't anything I 've ever do that I do n't want to do better. `` I would like , if I can , to broaden the possibility of the musical theater. I think there 's a good 'Oklahoma ! ' someplace , a good 'West Side Story. ' And I 'd like to be mix up in it.
